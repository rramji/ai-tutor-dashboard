Qualitative Relationship: When  \ud835\udc45 \u226b \ud835\udf06 R\u226b\u03bb, the bulk of the droplet contributes to heat absorption, and the latent heat behaves like in bulk materials. However, when  \ud835\udc45 R approaches  \ud835\udf06 \u03bb (nanoscale regime):  Surface-Dominated Energy Absorption: Heat transfer is confined to a thin layer of thickness  \ud835\udf06 \u03bb near the droplet\u2019s surface. Reduced Effective Volume: The volume effectively contributing to phase change is proportional to the skin layer\u2019s volume, scaling with  \ud835\udf06 \u03bb rather than  \ud835\udc45 R. Approximate Equation: \ud835\udc3f nano \u221d \ud835\udf0c \u2009 \ud835\udc50 \u2009 \ud835\udf06 \u2009 \ud835\udc34 L  nano \u200b  \u221d\u03c1c\u03bbA Where:  \ud835\udc3f nano L  nano \u200b   is the latent heat for the nanoscale droplet. \ud835\udf0c \u03c1 is the liquid's density. \ud835\udc50 c is the specific heat capacity. \ud835\udf06 \u03bb is the skin depth. \ud835\udc34 = 4 \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc45 2 A=4\u03c0R  2   is the surface area of the droplet. This shows that latent heat scales with the surface area and skin depth rather than the full volume. As  \ud835\udc45 R decreases to the nanoscale, the ratio  \ud835\udf06 / \ud835\udc45 \u03bb/R becomes significant, leading to a reduced latent heat compared to bulk liquids.",
