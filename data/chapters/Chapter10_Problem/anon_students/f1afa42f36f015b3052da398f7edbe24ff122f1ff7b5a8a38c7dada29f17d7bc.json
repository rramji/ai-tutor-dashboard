Smaller animals have a higher surface area to volume ratio; therefore, they lose energy must faster because there is a higher surface area compared to volume over which heat can diffuse in the form of flux. Thus, in order to keep a stable temperature, they  have a higher metabolic rates since the metabolic rate is proportional to temperature. However, a higher metabolic rate also means that they expend energy faster as well. Thus, their heart beats faster to meet these increased energy demands since a faster heart rate means that the heart is pumping more blood and therefore, more oxygen and nutrients are being transported to sustain their high metabolic needs. This puts more strain and stress on the cardiovascular system and results in the system to become more prone to damage over time, leading to a lower life span. Larger animals don\u2019t need as high of a metabolic rate because they don\u2019t lose heat as readily due to their lower surface-area ratio; thus, they don\u2019t have as a high of a heart rate and generally have longer life spans.

This results in a weaker surface tension force and therefore, an extremely small minsicus of water in between the rocks, so small , in fact, that it can\u2019t create a stable capillary bridge in order for the rocks to stick. There would need to be an enormous amount of water in order to form a large enough minsicus. On the other hand, sand grains are extremely small, with a much larger surface area to volume ratio. Therefore, little water is needed to form a large enough miniscus and strong enough surface tension",
