However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",
