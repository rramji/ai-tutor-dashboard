However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling.

For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1.

      "content": "#### Section 1: Scaling laws: A consequence of math or physics?\nNanoscale structures derive many of their unique properties from weird\neffects of quantum confinement (e.g., the particle in a box model),\ninteractions arising from transient dipoles (i.e., London dispersion),\nand effects arising from statistical physics (i.e., entropy). However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Skin-depth effects\nAtoms and molecules near the surface of matter in a condensed phase, for\nexample a solid or liquid, are relatively high in potential energy. Such\natoms would prefer to be interacting with atoms like them in the bulk,\nas opposed to interacting with the vacuum, air, or a solvent medium. In\nthe bulk, atoms are engaged in van der Waals interactions and other\nfavorable electrostatic or metallic forms of bonding. The lack of\nfavorable interactions lead to the most pronounced effects for the atoms\nnear the surface. In fact, the atoms don't have to be exactly at the\nsurface to have reduced intensity of interactions with atoms in the\nbulk. So-called **multibody effects** owing to the alignment of dipoles\nproduce cooperative attraction that extends some small number of\natoms---i.e., a few nanometers---into the bulk. This thickness, called\nthe \"skin depth,\" leads to a number of disparate and important\nphenomena, which we discuss below.\n\n### 10.2.1. Cohesive energy loss\n\nWe saw in chapter 2, the molar cohesive energy of a condensed phase of\nmatter is derived from summing up the individual interactions of each\natom or molecule with its neighbors. Given the presence of longer range,\nmultibody effects, it turns out that the molar cohesive energy of a\nsolid or liquid is around a factor of 7.22 times the intermolecular pair\npotential for atoms or molecules of the substance at contact. The total\nexpression is\n\n(Equation 10.1) $$E_{cohesive}=6w(\\sigma)N_{A}$$\n\n(Equation 10.2) $$E_{cohesive}=7.22w(\\sigma)N_{A} \n        % (considering long-range effects)$$\n\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The factor of $N_A$, which has units\nof mol$^{-1}$, ensures that the final quantity has units of energy per\nmole.\n\nNote that the weird factor of 7.22 in equation (10.2) is an empirical\n(experimentally determined) correction to the value of 6 shown in\nequation (10.1). We would obtain a value of 6 if we considered a liquid\nor solid in a close-packed arrangement, where the number of nearest\nneighbors was 12. (We get from 12 to 6 because each atom contributes\nhalf the bonding energy to each interaction with each one of its nearest\nneighbors. We divide by two to prevent over accounting, and thus arrive\nat 6.) The correction to a factor of 7.22 is a consequence of the fact\nthat the van der Waals interactions actually extend a few atoms away\nfrom the reference atom.\n\nThe value of the molar cohesive energy given by equation (10.2) holds\ntrue for a large slab of a material. That is, when the vast majority of\natoms are contained in the bulk of the sample, away from the surface.\nHowever, what about for nanoscale materials? That is, what happens as we\nconsider a nanoscale structure, whose composition is dominated by the\nproperties of atoms close to the surface? If we are, say 10 atoms or\nmore into the surface (i.e., 3 to 5 nm deep), the environment\nexperienced by those atoms is pretty much like those in the bulk.\nHowever, as we proceed toward the surface, that extra factor of 1.22\n(i.e., 7.22$-$`<!-- -->`{=html}6) which adds to the cohesive energy\nbegins to shrink. Once we get to the top surface, the attractive\nenergies due to long range interactions disappear. Moreover, the factor\nof 6 will also drop, because at the surface, there are no longer 12\nnearest neighbors!\n\nSo, the atoms in the \"skin\" of a liquid or solid experience less overall\nfavorable interactions than do atoms in the bulk. Consider for example a\nthin film of gold with a thickness of 20 nm. If skin-depth effects\npenetrate to a distance of 5 nm, then half of the atoms---if one takes\ninto account the top and bottom surface---will lie within the skin!\nSince the atoms in the skin have reduced interaction energies, the\ncohesive energy of the entire object decreases. This decreased cohesion\nhas many consequences, including reduction in melting point in solids,\nand decreased surface tension in liquids. These phenomena will be\ndescribed below.\n\n### 10.2.2. Melting point depression\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this reduction in cohesive energy\ndensity is in the melting point, which for solid nanoparticles is\nreduced by\n\n(Equation 10.3) $$T_R=T_{bulk}(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{R})$$\n\nwhere $T_R$ is the melting temperature of the nanoparticle, $T_{bulk}$\nis the melting point of a bulk, macroscopic slab of the material,\n$\\lambda$ is the skin depth (1-3 nm for metals) and $R$ is the height or\nthickness of a nanoparticle. The effects of melting point depression in\nnanoparticles can be exploited through **sintering**. That is, fusing\ntogether as a solid object using heat or even light, at much lower\ntemperatures and energies than samples of the same material in the bulk.\n\nThe effect of melting point depression also manifests in\nnanoelectronics, especially in cases where nanostructures are expected\nto withstand relatively large currents. I remember one time in graduate\nschool when I was fabricating nanowires of various metals for use in\nchemical and biochemical sensors. In one set of experiments, I was\ntrying to measure the conductivity of metallic nanowires by connecting\nthem to a **source measure unit** (SMU, see Chapter 9, where we used an\nSMU to measure the properties of a solar cell) and measuring current\nflow as a function of applied voltage. So, I painstakingly stenciled the\nlocations of electrodes at the termini of each nanowire, and deposited\nthe electrodes through the hand-made stencil masks by thermal\nevaporation. Upon performing the electrical measurements, each wire\nshowed conductivity for only a few moments and then became an open\ncircuit (i.e., effectively infinite resistance). I couldn't figure out\nwhat was happening until I looked at the failed nanowires under SEM.\nWhat I observed in each case was the same: a broken region of the\nnanowire a few hundred nanometers in width, in which each end of the\nnanowire adopted a bulbous shape like two opposing lollipops (see Figure\n(10.2)).\n\n(Figure 10.2) \n>>>image(lollipops.png.0)\n\nWhy did the breakage occur and why did the termini of the wires adopt\nsuch an unusual shape? It turned out that the electrical current led to\na phenomenon called **joule heating**, which occurs when electrons\ntravel fast through a conductor.[^10.2.1] The wire got so hot that it melted\nin (most likely) the thinnest region. A thicker wire would have been\nable to withstand much greater currents without melting. The reason is\nthat for a thinner and thinner wire, \\<\\<100 nm, an increasing fraction\nof atoms are at the surface. These atoms are there for missing some of\ntheir long and short range bonds with nearby atoms, and the overall\nmelting point is decreased. To solve my problem, I simply reduced the\nmaximum voltage applied to the nanowires from $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 V\nto $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10 mV. Using these parameters, I still obtained\nsufficiently large currents to measure the conductivity, but without the\njoule heating that led to melting and therefore failure of the\nnanowires.\n\n### 10.2.3. Surface tension reduction\n\nRecall from Chapter 4 that the surface tension arises from the increase\nin potential energy that occurs when a molecule in a liquid it rises\nfrom the bulk to the surface. That is, it takes work to expand a surface\nin an amount proportional to the amount of new surface created. In other\nwords, the work needed is proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules that were forced to the surface as a result of expansion. The\ndifference in potential energy between a sample with a large surface\narea vs. the same sample with a small surface area creates a force which\nacts to contract the surface. From the standpoint of individual atoms\nand molecules, there is a driving force for them to dive back into the\nbulk so as to have all of their valencies satisfied. This constant\ngradient and potential energy from high at the surface to low in the\nbulk acts to remove atoms from the surface and thus to produce a\ncontractile force: the surface tension.\n\nConsider now that it is not only the atoms at the very surface that have\nunsatisfied valancies. Just as in the case with melting point\ndepression, there is a skin depth effect. The resulting surface tension\nis given by the Tolman equation, as follows in equation (10.4):\n\n(Equation 10.4)\n$$\\gamma_R=\\gamma_{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\lambda}{R}}$$\n\nwhere the variables are defined in the description of equation (10.3).\nThe reason that the surface tension decreases with\nthickness---especially as the thickness approaches the skin depth---is\nthat there is an overall less energetic benefit for an atom to retreat\nto the \"bulk,\" *since the atoms in the bulk are still in the skin depth\nand thus already quite unsatisfied*. So, they don't get the full\nenergetic benefit of submerging themselves and are thus less inclined to\ndo so. Think about our conception of force being the negative rate of\nchange of the potential energy with respect to a geometric change, that\nis, equation (10.5):\n\n(Equation 10.5) $$F(D) = \\frac{-dW(D)}{dD}$$\n\nWhere, in this case, you can think about the dimension $D$ as the size\nof the liquid surface, and $dD$ as an incremental increase or decrease\nin this dimension. Looking at this equation, we see that the force\n(i.e., the surface tension) is smaller when the change in energy,\n$dW(D)$, is small with respect to the change in dimension, $dD$. Despite\nthe reduction in surface tension for ultrathin films and droplets of\nliquid, it can still be a powerful enough force to wreak havoc on small\nstructures.\n\n[^10.2.1]: The same thing happens with the power cord of a high current\n    device like a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer after extended use.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Scaling laws: A consequence of math or physics?\nNanoscale structures derive many of their unique properties from weird\neffects of quantum confinement (e.g., the particle in a box model),\ninteractions arising from transient dipoles (i.e., London dispersion),\nand effects arising from statistical physics (i.e., entropy). However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Skin-depth effects\nAtoms and molecules near the surface of matter in a condensed phase, for\nexample a solid or liquid, are relatively high in potential energy. Such\natoms would prefer to be interacting with atoms like them in the bulk,\nas opposed to interacting with the vacuum, air, or a solvent medium. In\nthe bulk, atoms are engaged in van der Waals interactions and other\nfavorable electrostatic or metallic forms of bonding. The lack of\nfavorable interactions lead to the most pronounced effects for the atoms\nnear the surface. In fact, the atoms don't have to be exactly at the\nsurface to have reduced intensity of interactions with atoms in the\nbulk. So-called **multibody effects** owing to the alignment of dipoles\nproduce cooperative attraction that extends some small number of\natoms---i.e., a few nanometers---into the bulk. This thickness, called\nthe \"skin depth,\" leads to a number of disparate and important\nphenomena, which we discuss below.\n\n### 10.2.1. Cohesive energy loss\n\nWe saw in chapter 2, the molar cohesive energy of a condensed phase of\nmatter is derived from summing up the individual interactions of each\natom or molecule with its neighbors. Given the presence of longer range,\nmultibody effects, it turns out that the molar cohesive energy of a\nsolid or liquid is around a factor of 7.22 times the intermolecular pair\npotential for atoms or molecules of the substance at contact. The total\nexpression is\n\n(Equation 10.1) $$E_{cohesive}=6w(\\sigma)N_{A}$$\n\n(Equation 10.2) $$E_{cohesive}=7.22w(\\sigma)N_{A} \n        % (considering long-range effects)$$\n\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The factor of $N_A$, which has units\nof mol$^{-1}$, ensures that the final quantity has units of energy per\nmole.\n\nNote that the weird factor of 7.22 in equation (10.2) is an empirical\n(experimentally determined) correction to the value of 6 shown in\nequation (10.1). We would obtain a value of 6 if we considered a liquid\nor solid in a close-packed arrangement, where the number of nearest\nneighbors was 12. (We get from 12 to 6 because each atom contributes\nhalf the bonding energy to each interaction with each one of its nearest\nneighbors. We divide by two to prevent over accounting, and thus arrive\nat 6.) The correction to a factor of 7.22 is a consequence of the fact\nthat the van der Waals interactions actually extend a few atoms away\nfrom the reference atom.\n\nThe value of the molar cohesive energy given by equation (10.2) holds\ntrue for a large slab of a material. That is, when the vast majority of\natoms are contained in the bulk of the sample, away from the surface.\nHowever, what about for nanoscale materials? That is, what happens as we\nconsider a nanoscale structure, whose composition is dominated by the\nproperties of atoms close to the surface? If we are, say 10 atoms or\nmore into the surface (i.e., 3 to 5 nm deep), the environment\nexperienced by those atoms is pretty much like those in the bulk.\nHowever, as we proceed toward the surface, that extra factor of 1.22\n(i.e., 7.22$-$`<!-- -->`{=html}6) which adds to the cohesive energy\nbegins to shrink. Once we get to the top surface, the attractive\nenergies due to long range interactions disappear. Moreover, the factor\nof 6 will also drop, because at the surface, there are no longer 12\nnearest neighbors!\n\nSo, the atoms in the \"skin\" of a liquid or solid experience less overall\nfavorable interactions than do atoms in the bulk. Consider for example a\nthin film of gold with a thickness of 20 nm. If skin-depth effects\npenetrate to a distance of 5 nm, then half of the atoms---if one takes\ninto account the top and bottom surface---will lie within the skin!\nSince the atoms in the skin have reduced interaction energies, the\ncohesive energy of the entire object decreases. This decreased cohesion\nhas many consequences, including reduction in melting point in solids,\nand decreased surface tension in liquids. These phenomena will be\ndescribed below.\n\n### 10.2.2. Melting point depression\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this reduction in cohesive energy\ndensity is in the melting point, which for solid nanoparticles is\nreduced by\n\n(Equation 10.3) $$T_R=T_{bulk}(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{R})$$\n\nwhere $T_R$ is the melting temperature of the nanoparticle, $T_{bulk}$\nis the melting point of a bulk, macroscopic slab of the material,\n$\\lambda$ is the skin depth (1-3 nm for metals) and $R$ is the height or\nthickness of a nanoparticle. The effects of melting point depression in\nnanoparticles can be exploited through **sintering**. That is, fusing\ntogether as a solid object using heat or even light, at much lower\ntemperatures and energies than samples of the same material in the bulk.\n\nThe effect of melting point depression also manifests in\nnanoelectronics, especially in cases where nanostructures are expected\nto withstand relatively large currents. I remember one time in graduate\nschool when I was fabricating nanowires of various metals for use in\nchemical and biochemical sensors. In one set of experiments, I was\ntrying to measure the conductivity of metallic nanowires by connecting\nthem to a **source measure unit** (SMU, see Chapter 9, where we used an\nSMU to measure the properties of a solar cell) and measuring current\nflow as a function of applied voltage. So, I painstakingly stenciled the\nlocations of electrodes at the termini of each nanowire, and deposited\nthe electrodes through the hand-made stencil masks by thermal\nevaporation. Upon performing the electrical measurements, each wire\nshowed conductivity for only a few moments and then became an open\ncircuit (i.e., effectively infinite resistance). I couldn't figure out\nwhat was happening until I looked at the failed nanowires under SEM.\nWhat I observed in each case was the same: a broken region of the\nnanowire a few hundred nanometers in width, in which each end of the\nnanowire adopted a bulbous shape like two opposing lollipops (see Figure\n(10.2)).\n\n(Figure 10.2) \n>>>image(lollipops.png.0)\n\nWhy did the breakage occur and why did the termini of the wires adopt\nsuch an unusual shape? It turned out that the electrical current led to\na phenomenon called **joule heating**, which occurs when electrons\ntravel fast through a conductor.[^10.2.1] The wire got so hot that it melted\nin (most likely) the thinnest region. A thicker wire would have been\nable to withstand much greater currents without melting. The reason is\nthat for a thinner and thinner wire, \\<\\<100 nm, an increasing fraction\nof atoms are at the surface. These atoms are there for missing some of\ntheir long and short range bonds with nearby atoms, and the overall\nmelting point is decreased. To solve my problem, I simply reduced the\nmaximum voltage applied to the nanowires from $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 V\nto $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10 mV. Using these parameters, I still obtained\nsufficiently large currents to measure the conductivity, but without the\njoule heating that led to melting and therefore failure of the\nnanowires.\n\n### 10.2.3. Surface tension reduction\n\nRecall from Chapter 4 that the surface tension arises from the increase\nin potential energy that occurs when a molecule in a liquid it rises\nfrom the bulk to the surface. That is, it takes work to expand a surface\nin an amount proportional to the amount of new surface created. In other\nwords, the work needed is proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules that were forced to the surface as a result of expansion. The\ndifference in potential energy between a sample with a large surface\narea vs. the same sample with a small surface area creates a force which\nacts to contract the surface. From the standpoint of individual atoms\nand molecules, there is a driving force for them to dive back into the\nbulk so as to have all of their valencies satisfied. This constant\ngradient and potential energy from high at the surface to low in the\nbulk acts to remove atoms from the surface and thus to produce a\ncontractile force: the surface tension.\n\nConsider now that it is not only the atoms at the very surface that have\nunsatisfied valancies. Just as in the case with melting point\ndepression, there is a skin depth effect. The resulting surface tension\nis given by the Tolman equation, as follows in equation (10.4):\n\n(Equation 10.4)\n$$\\gamma_R=\\gamma_{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\lambda}{R}}$$\n\nwhere the variables are defined in the description of equation (10.3).\nThe reason that the surface tension decreases with\nthickness---especially as the thickness approaches the skin depth---is\nthat there is an overall less energetic benefit for an atom to retreat\nto the \"bulk,\" *since the atoms in the bulk are still in the skin depth\nand thus already quite unsatisfied*. So, they don't get the full\nenergetic benefit of submerging themselves and are thus less inclined to\ndo so. Think about our conception of force being the negative rate of\nchange of the potential energy with respect to a geometric change, that\nis, equation (10.5):\n\n(Equation 10.5) $$F(D) = \\frac{-dW(D)}{dD}$$\n\nWhere, in this case, you can think about the dimension $D$ as the size\nof the liquid surface, and $dD$ as an incremental increase or decrease\nin this dimension. Looking at this equation, we see that the force\n(i.e., the surface tension) is smaller when the change in energy,\n$dW(D)$, is small with respect to the change in dimension, $dD$. Despite\nthe reduction in surface tension for ultrathin films and droplets of\nliquid, it can still be a powerful enough force to wreak havoc on small\nstructures.\n\n[^10.2.1]: The same thing happens with the power cord of a high current\n    device like a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer after extended use.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Scaling laws: A consequence of math or physics?\nNanoscale structures derive many of their unique properties from weird\neffects of quantum confinement (e.g., the particle in a box model),\ninteractions arising from transient dipoles (i.e., London dispersion),\nand effects arising from statistical physics (i.e., entropy). However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Skin-depth effects\nAtoms and molecules near the surface of matter in a condensed phase, for\nexample a solid or liquid, are relatively high in potential energy. Such\natoms would prefer to be interacting with atoms like them in the bulk,\nas opposed to interacting with the vacuum, air, or a solvent medium. In\nthe bulk, atoms are engaged in van der Waals interactions and other\nfavorable electrostatic or metallic forms of bonding. The lack of\nfavorable interactions lead to the most pronounced effects for the atoms\nnear the surface. In fact, the atoms don't have to be exactly at the\nsurface to have reduced intensity of interactions with atoms in the\nbulk. So-called **multibody effects** owing to the alignment of dipoles\nproduce cooperative attraction that extends some small number of\natoms---i.e., a few nanometers---into the bulk. This thickness, called\nthe \"skin depth,\" leads to a number of disparate and important\nphenomena, which we discuss below.\n\n### 10.2.1. Cohesive energy loss\n\nWe saw in chapter 2, the molar cohesive energy of a condensed phase of\nmatter is derived from summing up the individual interactions of each\natom or molecule with its neighbors. Given the presence of longer range,\nmultibody effects, it turns out that the molar cohesive energy of a\nsolid or liquid is around a factor of 7.22 times the intermolecular pair\npotential for atoms or molecules of the substance at contact. The total\nexpression is\n\n(Equation 10.1) $$E_{cohesive}=6w(\\sigma)N_{A}$$\n\n(Equation 10.2) $$E_{cohesive}=7.22w(\\sigma)N_{A} \n        % (considering long-range effects)$$\n\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The factor of $N_A$, which has units\nof mol$^{-1}$, ensures that the final quantity has units of energy per\nmole.\n\nNote that the weird factor of 7.22 in equation (10.2) is an empirical\n(experimentally determined) correction to the value of 6 shown in\nequation (10.1). We would obtain a value of 6 if we considered a liquid\nor solid in a close-packed arrangement, where the number of nearest\nneighbors was 12. (We get from 12 to 6 because each atom contributes\nhalf the bonding energy to each interaction with each one of its nearest\nneighbors. We divide by two to prevent over accounting, and thus arrive\nat 6.) The correction to a factor of 7.22 is a consequence of the fact\nthat the van der Waals interactions actually extend a few atoms away\nfrom the reference atom.\n\nThe value of the molar cohesive energy given by equation (10.2) holds\ntrue for a large slab of a material. That is, when the vast majority of\natoms are contained in the bulk of the sample, away from the surface.\nHowever, what about for nanoscale materials? That is, what happens as we\nconsider a nanoscale structure, whose composition is dominated by the\nproperties of atoms close to the surface? If we are, say 10 atoms or\nmore into the surface (i.e., 3 to 5 nm deep), the environment\nexperienced by those atoms is pretty much like those in the bulk.\nHowever, as we proceed toward the surface, that extra factor of 1.22\n(i.e., 7.22$-$`<!-- -->`{=html}6) which adds to the cohesive energy\nbegins to shrink. Once we get to the top surface, the attractive\nenergies due to long range interactions disappear. Moreover, the factor\nof 6 will also drop, because at the surface, there are no longer 12\nnearest neighbors!\n\nSo, the atoms in the \"skin\" of a liquid or solid experience less overall\nfavorable interactions than do atoms in the bulk. Consider for example a\nthin film of gold with a thickness of 20 nm. If skin-depth effects\npenetrate to a distance of 5 nm, then half of the atoms---if one takes\ninto account the top and bottom surface---will lie within the skin!\nSince the atoms in the skin have reduced interaction energies, the\ncohesive energy of the entire object decreases. This decreased cohesion\nhas many consequences, including reduction in melting point in solids,\nand decreased surface tension in liquids. These phenomena will be\ndescribed below.\n\n### 10.2.2. Melting point depression\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this reduction in cohesive energy\ndensity is in the melting point, which for solid nanoparticles is\nreduced by\n\n(Equation 10.3) $$T_R=T_{bulk}(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{R})$$\n\nwhere $T_R$ is the melting temperature of the nanoparticle, $T_{bulk}$\nis the melting point of a bulk, macroscopic slab of the material,\n$\\lambda$ is the skin depth (1-3 nm for metals) and $R$ is the height or\nthickness of a nanoparticle. The effects of melting point depression in\nnanoparticles can be exploited through **sintering**. That is, fusing\ntogether as a solid object using heat or even light, at much lower\ntemperatures and energies than samples of the same material in the bulk.\n\nThe effect of melting point depression also manifests in\nnanoelectronics, especially in cases where nanostructures are expected\nto withstand relatively large currents. I remember one time in graduate\nschool when I was fabricating nanowires of various metals for use in\nchemical and biochemical sensors. In one set of experiments, I was\ntrying to measure the conductivity of metallic nanowires by connecting\nthem to a **source measure unit** (SMU, see Chapter 9, where we used an\nSMU to measure the properties of a solar cell) and measuring current\nflow as a function of applied voltage. So, I painstakingly stenciled the\nlocations of electrodes at the termini of each nanowire, and deposited\nthe electrodes through the hand-made stencil masks by thermal\nevaporation. Upon performing the electrical measurements, each wire\nshowed conductivity for only a few moments and then became an open\ncircuit (i.e., effectively infinite resistance). I couldn't figure out\nwhat was happening until I looked at the failed nanowires under SEM.\nWhat I observed in each case was the same: a broken region of the\nnanowire a few hundred nanometers in width, in which each end of the\nnanowire adopted a bulbous shape like two opposing lollipops (see Figure\n(10.2)).\n\n(Figure 10.2) \n>>>image(lollipops.png.0)\n\nWhy did the breakage occur and why did the termini of the wires adopt\nsuch an unusual shape? It turned out that the electrical current led to\na phenomenon called **joule heating**, which occurs when electrons\ntravel fast through a conductor.[^10.2.1] The wire got so hot that it melted\nin (most likely) the thinnest region. A thicker wire would have been\nable to withstand much greater currents without melting. The reason is\nthat for a thinner and thinner wire, \\<\\<100 nm, an increasing fraction\nof atoms are at the surface. These atoms are there for missing some of\ntheir long and short range bonds with nearby atoms, and the overall\nmelting point is decreased. To solve my problem, I simply reduced the\nmaximum voltage applied to the nanowires from $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 V\nto $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10 mV. Using these parameters, I still obtained\nsufficiently large currents to measure the conductivity, but without the\njoule heating that led to melting and therefore failure of the\nnanowires.\n\n### 10.2.3. Surface tension reduction\n\nRecall from Chapter 4 that the surface tension arises from the increase\nin potential energy that occurs when a molecule in a liquid it rises\nfrom the bulk to the surface. That is, it takes work to expand a surface\nin an amount proportional to the amount of new surface created. In other\nwords, the work needed is proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules that were forced to the surface as a result of expansion. The\ndifference in potential energy between a sample with a large surface\narea vs. the same sample with a small surface area creates a force which\nacts to contract the surface. From the standpoint of individual atoms\nand molecules, there is a driving force for them to dive back into the\nbulk so as to have all of their valencies satisfied.

      "content": "#### Section 1: Scaling laws: A consequence of math or physics?\nNanoscale structures derive many of their unique properties from weird\neffects of quantum confinement (e.g., the particle in a box model),\ninteractions arising from transient dipoles (i.e., London dispersion),\nand effects arising from statistical physics (i.e., entropy). However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Skin-depth effects\nAtoms and molecules near the surface of matter in a condensed phase, for\nexample a solid or liquid, are relatively high in potential energy. Such\natoms would prefer to be interacting with atoms like them in the bulk,\nas opposed to interacting with the vacuum, air, or a solvent medium. In\nthe bulk, atoms are engaged in van der Waals interactions and other\nfavorable electrostatic or metallic forms of bonding. The lack of\nfavorable interactions lead to the most pronounced effects for the atoms\nnear the surface. In fact, the atoms don't have to be exactly at the\nsurface to have reduced intensity of interactions with atoms in the\nbulk. So-called **multibody effects** owing to the alignment of dipoles\nproduce cooperative attraction that extends some small number of\natoms---i.e., a few nanometers---into the bulk. This thickness, called\nthe \"skin depth,\" leads to a number of disparate and important\nphenomena, which we discuss below.\n\n### 10.2.1. Cohesive energy loss\n\nWe saw in chapter 2, the molar cohesive energy of a condensed phase of\nmatter is derived from summing up the individual interactions of each\natom or molecule with its neighbors. Given the presence of longer range,\nmultibody effects, it turns out that the molar cohesive energy of a\nsolid or liquid is around a factor of 7.22 times the intermolecular pair\npotential for atoms or molecules of the substance at contact. The total\nexpression is\n\n(Equation 10.1) $$E_{cohesive}=6w(\\sigma)N_{A}$$\n\n(Equation 10.2) $$E_{cohesive}=7.22w(\\sigma)N_{A} \n        % (considering long-range effects)$$\n\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The factor of $N_A$, which has units\nof mol$^{-1}$, ensures that the final quantity has units of energy per\nmole.\n\nNote that the weird factor of 7.22 in equation (10.2) is an empirical\n(experimentally determined) correction to the value of 6 shown in\nequation (10.1). We would obtain a value of 6 if we considered a liquid\nor solid in a close-packed arrangement, where the number of nearest\nneighbors was 12. (We get from 12 to 6 because each atom contributes\nhalf the bonding energy to each interaction with each one of its nearest\nneighbors. We divide by two to prevent over accounting, and thus arrive\nat 6.) The correction to a factor of 7.22 is a consequence of the fact\nthat the van der Waals interactions actually extend a few atoms away\nfrom the reference atom.\n\nThe value of the molar cohesive energy given by equation (10.2) holds\ntrue for a large slab of a material. That is, when the vast majority of\natoms are contained in the bulk of the sample, away from the surface.\nHowever, what about for nanoscale materials? That is, what happens as we\nconsider a nanoscale structure, whose composition is dominated by the\nproperties of atoms close to the surface? If we are, say 10 atoms or\nmore into the surface (i.e., 3 to 5 nm deep), the environment\nexperienced by those atoms is pretty much like those in the bulk.\nHowever, as we proceed toward the surface, that extra factor of 1.22\n(i.e., 7.22$-$`<!-- -->`{=html}6) which adds to the cohesive energy\nbegins to shrink. Once we get to the top surface, the attractive\nenergies due to long range interactions disappear. Moreover, the factor\nof 6 will also drop, because at the surface, there are no longer 12\nnearest neighbors!\n\nSo, the atoms in the \"skin\" of a liquid or solid experience less overall\nfavorable interactions than do atoms in the bulk. Consider for example a\nthin film of gold with a thickness of 20 nm. If skin-depth effects\npenetrate to a distance of 5 nm, then half of the atoms---if one takes\ninto account the top and bottom surface---will lie within the skin!\nSince the atoms in the skin have reduced interaction energies, the\ncohesive energy of the entire object decreases. This decreased cohesion\nhas many consequences, including reduction in melting point in solids,\nand decreased surface tension in liquids. These phenomena will be\ndescribed below.\n\n### 10.2.2. Melting point depression\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this reduction in cohesive energy\ndensity is in the melting point, which for solid nanoparticles is\nreduced by\n\n(Equation 10.3) $$T_R=T_{bulk}(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{R})$$\n\nwhere $T_R$ is the melting temperature of the nanoparticle, $T_{bulk}$\nis the melting point of a bulk, macroscopic slab of the material,\n$\\lambda$ is the skin depth (1-3 nm for metals) and $R$ is the height or\nthickness of a nanoparticle. The effects of melting point depression in\nnanoparticles can be exploited through **sintering**. That is, fusing\ntogether as a solid object using heat or even light, at much lower\ntemperatures and energies than samples of the same material in the bulk.\n\nThe effect of melting point depression also manifests in\nnanoelectronics, especially in cases where nanostructures are expected\nto withstand relatively large currents. I remember one time in graduate\nschool when I was fabricating nanowires of various metals for use in\nchemical and biochemical sensors. In one set of experiments, I was\ntrying to measure the conductivity of metallic nanowires by connecting\nthem to a **source measure unit** (SMU, see Chapter 9, where we used an\nSMU to measure the properties of a solar cell) and measuring current\nflow as a function of applied voltage. So, I painstakingly stenciled the\nlocations of electrodes at the termini of each nanowire, and deposited\nthe electrodes through the hand-made stencil masks by thermal\nevaporation. Upon performing the electrical measurements, each wire\nshowed conductivity for only a few moments and then became an open\ncircuit (i.e., effectively infinite resistance). I couldn't figure out\nwhat was happening until I looked at the failed nanowires under SEM.\nWhat I observed in each case was the same: a broken region of the\nnanowire a few hundred nanometers in width, in which each end of the\nnanowire adopted a bulbous shape like two opposing lollipops (see Figure\n(10.2)).\n\n(Figure 10.2) \n>>>image(lollipops.png.0)\n\nWhy did the breakage occur and why did the termini of the wires adopt\nsuch an unusual shape? It turned out that the electrical current led to\na phenomenon called **joule heating**, which occurs when electrons\ntravel fast through a conductor.[^10.2.1] The wire got so hot that it melted\nin (most likely) the thinnest region. A thicker wire would have been\nable to withstand much greater currents without melting. The reason is\nthat for a thinner and thinner wire, \\<\\<100 nm, an increasing fraction\nof atoms are at the surface. These atoms are there for missing some of\ntheir long and short range bonds with nearby atoms, and the overall\nmelting point is decreased. To solve my problem, I simply reduced the\nmaximum voltage applied to the nanowires from $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 V\nto $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10 mV. Using these parameters, I still obtained\nsufficiently large currents to measure the conductivity, but without the\njoule heating that led to melting and therefore failure of the\nnanowires.\n\n### 10.2.3. Surface tension reduction\n\nRecall from Chapter 4 that the surface tension arises from the increase\nin potential energy that occurs when a molecule in a liquid it rises\nfrom the bulk to the surface. That is, it takes work to expand a surface\nin an amount proportional to the amount of new surface created. In other\nwords, the work needed is proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules that were forced to the surface as a result of expansion. The\ndifference in potential energy between a sample with a large surface\narea vs. the same sample with a small surface area creates a force which\nacts to contract the surface. From the standpoint of individual atoms\nand molecules, there is a driving force for them to dive back into the\nbulk so as to have all of their valencies satisfied. This constant\ngradient and potential energy from high at the surface to low in the\nbulk acts to remove atoms from the surface and thus to produce a\ncontractile force: the surface tension.\n\nConsider now that it is not only the atoms at the very surface that have\nunsatisfied valancies. Just as in the case with melting point\ndepression, there is a skin depth effect. The resulting surface tension\nis given by the Tolman equation, as follows in equation (10.4):\n\n(Equation 10.4)\n$$\\gamma_R=\\gamma_{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\lambda}{R}}$$\n\nwhere the variables are defined in the description of equation (10.3).\nThe reason that the surface tension decreases with\nthickness---especially as the thickness approaches the skin depth---is\nthat there is an overall less energetic benefit for an atom to retreat\nto the \"bulk,\" *since the atoms in the bulk are still in the skin depth\nand thus already quite unsatisfied*. So, they don't get the full\nenergetic benefit of submerging themselves and are thus less inclined to\ndo so. Think about our conception of force being the negative rate of\nchange of the potential energy with respect to a geometric change, that\nis, equation (10.5):\n\n(Equation 10.5) $$F(D) = \\frac{-dW(D)}{dD}$$\n\nWhere, in this case, you can think about the dimension $D$ as the size\nof the liquid surface, and $dD$ as an incremental increase or decrease\nin this dimension. Looking at this equation, we see that the force\n(i.e., the surface tension) is smaller when the change in energy,\n$dW(D)$, is small with respect to the change in dimension, $dD$. Despite\nthe reduction in surface tension for ultrathin films and droplets of\nliquid, it can still be a powerful enough force to wreak havoc on small\nstructures.\n\n[^10.2.1]: The same thing happens with the power cord of a high current\n    device like a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer after extended use.\n",

However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Skin-depth effects\nAtoms and molecules near the surface of matter in a condensed phase, for\nexample a solid or liquid, are relatively high in potential energy. Such\natoms would prefer to be interacting with atoms like them in the bulk,\nas opposed to interacting with the vacuum, air, or a solvent medium. In\nthe bulk, atoms are engaged in van der Waals interactions and other\nfavorable electrostatic or metallic forms of bonding. The lack of\nfavorable interactions lead to the most pronounced effects for the atoms\nnear the surface. In fact, the atoms don't have to be exactly at the\nsurface to have reduced intensity of interactions with atoms in the\nbulk. So-called **multibody effects** owing to the alignment of dipoles\nproduce cooperative attraction that extends some small number of\natoms---i.e., a few nanometers---into the bulk. This thickness, called\nthe \"skin depth,\" leads to a number of disparate and important\nphenomena, which we discuss below.\n\n### 10.2.1. Cohesive energy loss\n\nWe saw in chapter 2, the molar cohesive energy of a condensed phase of\nmatter is derived from summing up the individual interactions of each\natom or molecule with its neighbors. Given the presence of longer range,\nmultibody effects, it turns out that the molar cohesive energy of a\nsolid or liquid is around a factor of 7.22 times the intermolecular pair\npotential for atoms or molecules of the substance at contact. The total\nexpression is\n\n(Equation 10.1) $$E_{cohesive}=6w(\\sigma)N_{A}$$\n\n(Equation 10.2) $$E_{cohesive}=7.22w(\\sigma)N_{A} \n        % (considering long-range effects)$$\n\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The factor of $N_A$, which has units\nof mol$^{-1}$, ensures that the final quantity has units of energy per\nmole.\n\nNote that the weird factor of 7.22 in equation (10.2) is an empirical\n(experimentally determined) correction to the value of 6 shown in\nequation (10.1). We would obtain a value of 6 if we considered a liquid\nor solid in a close-packed arrangement, where the number of nearest\nneighbors was 12. (We get from 12 to 6 because each atom contributes\nhalf the bonding energy to each interaction with each one of its nearest\nneighbors. We divide by two to prevent over accounting, and thus arrive\nat 6.) The correction to a factor of 7.22 is a consequence of the fact\nthat the van der Waals interactions actually extend a few atoms away\nfrom the reference atom.\n\nThe value of the molar cohesive energy given by equation (10.2) holds\ntrue for a large slab of a material. That is, when the vast majority of\natoms are contained in the bulk of the sample, away from the surface.\nHowever, what about for nanoscale materials? That is, what happens as we\nconsider a nanoscale structure, whose composition is dominated by the\nproperties of atoms close to the surface? If we are, say 10 atoms or\nmore into the surface (i.e., 3 to 5 nm deep), the environment\nexperienced by those atoms is pretty much like those in the bulk.\nHowever, as we proceed toward the surface, that extra factor of 1.22\n(i.e., 7.22$-$`<!-- -->`{=html}6) which adds to the cohesive energy\nbegins to shrink. Once we get to the top surface, the attractive\nenergies due to long range interactions disappear. Moreover, the factor\nof 6 will also drop, because at the surface, there are no longer 12\nnearest neighbors!\n\nSo, the atoms in the \"skin\" of a liquid or solid experience less overall\nfavorable interactions than do atoms in the bulk. Consider for example a\nthin film of gold with a thickness of 20 nm. If skin-depth effects\npenetrate to a distance of 5 nm, then half of the atoms---if one takes\ninto account the top and bottom surface---will lie within the skin!\nSince the atoms in the skin have reduced interaction energies, the\ncohesive energy of the entire object decreases. This decreased cohesion\nhas many consequences, including reduction in melting point in solids,\nand decreased surface tension in liquids. These phenomena will be\ndescribed below.\n\n### 10.2.2. Melting point depression\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this reduction in cohesive energy\ndensity is in the melting point, which for solid nanoparticles is\nreduced by\n\n(Equation 10.3) $$T_R=T_{bulk}(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{R})$$\n\nwhere $T_R$ is the melting temperature of the nanoparticle, $T_{bulk}$\nis the melting point of a bulk, macroscopic slab of the material,\n$\\lambda$ is the skin depth (1-3 nm for metals) and $R$ is the height or\nthickness of a nanoparticle. The effects of melting point depression in\nnanoparticles can be exploited through **sintering**. That is, fusing\ntogether as a solid object using heat or even light, at much lower\ntemperatures and energies than samples of the same material in the bulk.\n\nThe effect of melting point depression also manifests in\nnanoelectronics, especially in cases where nanostructures are expected\nto withstand relatively large currents. I remember one time in graduate\nschool when I was fabricating nanowires of various metals for use in\nchemical and biochemical sensors. In one set of experiments, I was\ntrying to measure the conductivity of metallic nanowires by connecting\nthem to a **source measure unit** (SMU, see Chapter 9, where we used an\nSMU to measure the properties of a solar cell) and measuring current\nflow as a function of applied voltage. So, I painstakingly stenciled the\nlocations of electrodes at the termini of each nanowire, and deposited\nthe electrodes through the hand-made stencil masks by thermal\nevaporation. Upon performing the electrical measurements, each wire\nshowed conductivity for only a few moments and then became an open\ncircuit (i.e., effectively infinite resistance). I couldn't figure out\nwhat was happening until I looked at the failed nanowires under SEM.\nWhat I observed in each case was the same: a broken region of the\nnanowire a few hundred nanometers in width, in which each end of the\nnanowire adopted a bulbous shape like two opposing lollipops (see Figure\n(10.2)).\n\n(Figure 10.2) \n>>>image(lollipops.png.0)\n\nWhy did the breakage occur and why did the termini of the wires adopt\nsuch an unusual shape? It turned out that the electrical current led to\na phenomenon called **joule heating**, which occurs when electrons\ntravel fast through a conductor.[^10.2.1] The wire got so hot that it melted\nin (most likely) the thinnest region. A thicker wire would have been\nable to withstand much greater currents without melting. The reason is\nthat for a thinner and thinner wire, \\<\\<100 nm, an increasing fraction\nof atoms are at the surface. These atoms are there for missing some of\ntheir long and short range bonds with nearby atoms, and the overall\nmelting point is decreased. To solve my problem, I simply reduced the\nmaximum voltage applied to the nanowires from $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 V\nto $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10 mV. Using these parameters, I still obtained\nsufficiently large currents to measure the conductivity, but without the\njoule heating that led to melting and therefore failure of the\nnanowires.\n\n### 10.2.3. Surface tension reduction\n\nRecall from Chapter 4 that the surface tension arises from the increase\nin potential energy that occurs when a molecule in a liquid it rises\nfrom the bulk to the surface. That is, it takes work to expand a surface\nin an amount proportional to the amount of new surface created. In other\nwords, the work needed is proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules that were forced to the surface as a result of expansion. The\ndifference in potential energy between a sample with a large surface\narea vs. the same sample with a small surface area creates a force which\nacts to contract the surface. From the standpoint of individual atoms\nand molecules, there is a driving force for them to dive back into the\nbulk so as to have all of their valencies satisfied. This constant\ngradient and potential energy from high at the surface to low in the\nbulk acts to remove atoms from the surface and thus to produce a\ncontractile force: the surface tension.\n\nConsider now that it is not only the atoms at the very surface that have\nunsatisfied valancies. Just as in the case with melting point\ndepression, there is a skin depth effect. The resulting surface tension\nis given by the Tolman equation, as follows in equation (10.4):\n\n(Equation 10.4)\n$$\\gamma_R=\\gamma_{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\lambda}{R}}$$\n\nwhere the variables are defined in the description of equation (10.3).\nThe reason that the surface tension decreases with\nthickness---especially as the thickness approaches the skin depth---is\nthat there is an overall less energetic benefit for an atom to retreat\nto the \"bulk,\" *since the atoms in the bulk are still in the skin depth\nand thus already quite unsatisfied*.

Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Skin-depth effects\nAtoms and molecules near the surface of matter in a condensed phase, for\nexample a solid or liquid, are relatively high in potential energy. Such\natoms would prefer to be interacting with atoms like them in the bulk,\nas opposed to interacting with the vacuum, air, or a solvent medium. In\nthe bulk, atoms are engaged in van der Waals interactions and other\nfavorable electrostatic or metallic forms of bonding. The lack of\nfavorable interactions lead to the most pronounced effects for the atoms\nnear the surface. In fact, the atoms don't have to be exactly at the\nsurface to have reduced intensity of interactions with atoms in the\nbulk. So-called **multibody effects** owing to the alignment of dipoles\nproduce cooperative attraction that extends some small number of\natoms---i.e., a few nanometers---into the bulk. This thickness, called\nthe \"skin depth,\" leads to a number of disparate and important\nphenomena, which we discuss below.\n\n### 10.2.1. Cohesive energy loss\n\nWe saw in chapter 2, the molar cohesive energy of a condensed phase of\nmatter is derived from summing up the individual interactions of each\natom or molecule with its neighbors. Given the presence of longer range,\nmultibody effects, it turns out that the molar cohesive energy of a\nsolid or liquid is around a factor of 7.22 times the intermolecular pair\npotential for atoms or molecules of the substance at contact. The total\nexpression is\n\n(Equation 10.1) $$E_{cohesive}=6w(\\sigma)N_{A}$$\n\n(Equation 10.2) $$E_{cohesive}=7.22w(\\sigma)N_{A} \n        % (considering long-range effects)$$\n\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The factor of $N_A$, which has units\nof mol$^{-1}$, ensures that the final quantity has units of energy per\nmole.\n\nNote that the weird factor of 7.22 in equation (10.2) is an empirical\n(experimentally determined) correction to the value of 6 shown in\nequation (10.1). We would obtain a value of 6 if we considered a liquid\nor solid in a close-packed arrangement, where the number of nearest\nneighbors was 12. (We get from 12 to 6 because each atom contributes\nhalf the bonding energy to each interaction with each one of its nearest\nneighbors. We divide by two to prevent over accounting, and thus arrive\nat 6.) The correction to a factor of 7.22 is a consequence of the fact\nthat the van der Waals interactions actually extend a few atoms away\nfrom the reference atom.\n\nThe value of the molar cohesive energy given by equation (10.2) holds\ntrue for a large slab of a material. That is, when the vast majority of\natoms are contained in the bulk of the sample, away from the surface.\nHowever, what about for nanoscale materials? That is, what happens as we\nconsider a nanoscale structure, whose composition is dominated by the\nproperties of atoms close to the surface? If we are, say 10 atoms or\nmore into the surface (i.e., 3 to 5 nm deep), the environment\nexperienced by those atoms is pretty much like those in the bulk.\nHowever, as we proceed toward the surface, that extra factor of 1.22\n(i.e., 7.22$-$`<!-- -->`{=html}6) which adds to the cohesive energy\nbegins to shrink. Once we get to the top surface, the attractive\nenergies due to long range interactions disappear. Moreover, the factor\nof 6 will also drop, because at the surface, there are no longer 12\nnearest neighbors!\n\nSo, the atoms in the \"skin\" of a liquid or solid experience less overall\nfavorable interactions than do atoms in the bulk. Consider for example a\nthin film of gold with a thickness of 20 nm. If skin-depth effects\npenetrate to a distance of 5 nm, then half of the atoms---if one takes\ninto account the top and bottom surface---will lie within the skin!\nSince the atoms in the skin have reduced interaction energies, the\ncohesive energy of the entire object decreases. This decreased cohesion\nhas many consequences, including reduction in melting point in solids,\nand decreased surface tension in liquids. These phenomena will be\ndescribed below.\n\n### 10.2.2. Melting point depression\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this reduction in cohesive energy\ndensity is in the melting point, which for solid nanoparticles is\nreduced by\n\n(Equation 10.3) $$T_R=T_{bulk}(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{R})$$\n\nwhere $T_R$ is the melting temperature of the nanoparticle, $T_{bulk}$\nis the melting point of a bulk, macroscopic slab of the material,\n$\\lambda$ is the skin depth (1-3 nm for metals) and $R$ is the height or\nthickness of a nanoparticle. The effects of melting point depression in\nnanoparticles can be exploited through **sintering**. That is, fusing\ntogether as a solid object using heat or even light, at much lower\ntemperatures and energies than samples of the same material in the bulk.\n\nThe effect of melting point depression also manifests in\nnanoelectronics, especially in cases where nanostructures are expected\nto withstand relatively large currents. I remember one time in graduate\nschool when I was fabricating nanowires of various metals for use in\nchemical and biochemical sensors. In one set of experiments, I was\ntrying to measure the conductivity of metallic nanowires by connecting\nthem to a **source measure unit** (SMU, see Chapter 9, where we used an\nSMU to measure the properties of a solar cell) and measuring current\nflow as a function of applied voltage. So, I painstakingly stenciled the\nlocations of electrodes at the termini of each nanowire, and deposited\nthe electrodes through the hand-made stencil masks by thermal\nevaporation. Upon performing the electrical measurements, each wire\nshowed conductivity for only a few moments and then became an open\ncircuit (i.e., effectively infinite resistance). I couldn't figure out\nwhat was happening until I looked at the failed nanowires under SEM.\nWhat I observed in each case was the same: a broken region of the\nnanowire a few hundred nanometers in width, in which each end of the\nnanowire adopted a bulbous shape like two opposing lollipops (see Figure\n(10.2)).\n\n(Figure 10.2) \n>>>image(lollipops.png.0)\n\nWhy did the breakage occur and why did the termini of the wires adopt\nsuch an unusual shape? It turned out that the electrical current led to\na phenomenon called **joule heating**, which occurs when electrons\ntravel fast through a conductor.[^10.2.1] The wire got so hot that it melted\nin (most likely) the thinnest region. A thicker wire would have been\nable to withstand much greater currents without melting. The reason is\nthat for a thinner and thinner wire, \\<\\<100 nm, an increasing fraction\nof atoms are at the surface. These atoms are there for missing some of\ntheir long and short range bonds with nearby atoms, and the overall\nmelting point is decreased. To solve my problem, I simply reduced the\nmaximum voltage applied to the nanowires from $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}1 V\nto $\\pm$`<!-- -->`{=html}10 mV. Using these parameters, I still obtained\nsufficiently large currents to measure the conductivity, but without the\njoule heating that led to melting and therefore failure of the\nnanowires.\n\n### 10.2.3. Surface tension reduction\n\nRecall from Chapter 4 that the surface tension arises from the increase\nin potential energy that occurs when a molecule in a liquid it rises\nfrom the bulk to the surface. That is, it takes work to expand a surface\nin an amount proportional to the amount of new surface created. In other\nwords, the work needed is proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules that were forced to the surface as a result of expansion. The\ndifference in potential energy between a sample with a large surface\narea vs. the same sample with a small surface area creates a force which\nacts to contract the surface. From the standpoint of individual atoms\nand molecules, there is a driving force for them to dive back into the\nbulk so as to have all of their valencies satisfied. This constant\ngradient and potential energy from high at the surface to low in the\nbulk acts to remove atoms from the surface and thus to produce a\ncontractile force: the surface tension.\n\nConsider now that it is not only the atoms at the very surface that have\nunsatisfied valancies. Just as in the case with melting point\ndepression, there is a skin depth effect. The resulting surface tension\nis given by the Tolman equation, as follows in equation (10.4):\n\n(Equation 10.4)\n$$\\gamma_R=\\gamma_{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\lambda}{R}}$$\n\nwhere the variables are defined in the description of equation (10.3).\nThe reason that the surface tension decreases with\nthickness---especially as the thickness approaches the skin depth---is\nthat there is an overall less energetic benefit for an atom to retreat\nto the \"bulk,\" *since the atoms in the bulk are still in the skin depth\nand thus already quite unsatisfied*. So, they don't get the full\nenergetic benefit of submerging themselves and are thus less inclined to\ndo so. Think about our conception of force being the negative rate of\nchange of the potential energy with respect to a geometric change, that\nis, equation (10.5):\n\n(Equation 10.5) $$F(D) = \\frac{-dW(D)}{dD}$$\n\nWhere, in this case, you can think about the dimension $D$ as the size\nof the liquid surface, and $dD$ as an incremental increase or decrease\nin this dimension. Looking at this equation, we see that the force\n(i.e., the surface tension) is smaller when the change in energy,\n$dW(D)$, is small with respect to the change in dimension, $dD$. Despite\nthe reduction in surface tension for ultrathin films and droplets of\nliquid, it can still be a powerful enough force to wreak havoc on small\nstructures.\n\n[^10.2.1]: The same thing happens with the power cord of a high current\n    device like a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer after extended use.\n",

However,\nsome of the most important properties of nanostructures arise simply\nbecause they are small. There are two vantage points from which to view\nthese effects of confinement and scaling. The first is from a\n**continuum** vantage point in which the molecular details are ignored.\nConsequences of this viewpoint include the fact that a hippopotamus must\nhave thicker legs relative to its mass than does a spider. The second\nvantage point is **atomistic** or **molecular**; it predicts---among\nother things---that the melting point of small objects is lower than\nthat of large objects of the same material because a greater proportion\nof the atoms of a small object are near the surface. For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg.

Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight.

For a video primer\nto this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/H3U8BQoQ-Ok)\n\nOne of the most interesting and ubiquitous effects of shrinking\nmaterials down to the nanoscale has nothing to do with van der Waals\nforces, or quantum mechanics, but with math. Not even complicated math\nlike calculus and statistics, but simple geometry. Consider a critical\nlinear dimension, call it $R$, which could be the radius of a circle,\nsphere, or cylinder, or the length of the edge of a cube. The dimensions\nof objects scale with different factors of $R$. The length scales with\n$R$, the area (including surface area) scales with $R^2$, and the\nvolume---and therefore the mass---scale with $R^3$. Many of the most\nimportant properties of nanomaterials come not strictly from physics but\nrather from the ways that these quantities scale relative to one another\nas $R$ shrinks to nanoscale dimensions.\n\nConsider the effect of decreasing the radius of a spherical particle.\nThe surface area is equal to $4\\pi R^2$, while the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Thus, the surface area to volume ratio decreases\nin proportion to $1/R$. So, as $R$ approaches \"nano,\" the ratio of\nsurface area to volume blows up.\n\nThe consequences of this relationship---and others that derive from it,\ne.g., the ratio of strength to weight and strength to volume---affect\nnearly every aspect of the mechanics of nanostructured materials and\ncomposites. Moreover such effects dictate the properties of nominally\n\"continuum materials,\" such as polymers, steel, and concrete. The reason\nis that the microstructure (a historical term for what should really be\ncalled the *nanostructure*) of such materials is dictated by processing,\nthermal history, and kinetics of solidification, as mediated by effects\nthat manifest on the nanoscale.\n\n### 10.1.1. Continuum vs. molecular scaling effects\n\nAs we have alluded in the introduction to this chapter, many of the\ninteresting effects of size confinement arise only from the arithmetic:\nthe surface area to volume scales with some factor of $1/R$ whether or\nnot the structure is even made of atoms! These effects are the result of\n**continuum scaling**. A continuum model ignores all internal structure,\nwhereas an **atomistic** or **molecular** model contains information\nabout the internal structure. Thus, in addition to the consequences of\nthe continuum (math-only) models, properties arise when materials are\nscaled down because real materials are made of atoms. The simplest\nconsequence can be stated as follows: when the ratio of surface area to\nvolume increases, an increasing fraction of the object's atoms are found\non the surface (see Figure (10.1)). As we will learn, atoms on the\nsurface have different properties than those found in the **bulk**\n(i.e., interior) of solids and liquids. For example, atoms near the\nsurfaces of catalytic particles tend to be more reactive than those in\nthe bulk. Moreover, the differences in energy between atoms in the\nsurface and those in the bulk give rise to well-known effects like\nsurface tension (recall from Chapter 4). The interactions of conduction\nelectrons at the surfaces of metals also give rise to **surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR)**, which is used widely in applications from\n\"invisibility cloaking\" to chemical and biochemical sensing. These and\nother effects of downsizing dimensions to the nanoscale are everywhere,\nand we will continue to encounter them as we look around at phenomena\nthat occur on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 10.1) \n>>>image(continuum molecular.png.0)\n\n### 10.1.2. Area to volume and strength-to-weight: hippos and spiders\n\nThe mass of an object scales with its volume, which scales roughly with\nthe cube of one of its linear dimensions. In contrast, the strength of\nan object scales with its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the\nload. To illustrate, consider a hippopotamus approximated as a sphere\n(as is customary). If the radius of the hippopotamus is 1 meter, and has\nroughly the same density as water\n($1000\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^{3}}$), then the volume is\n$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ or $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4m$^3$ and the mass is\n$\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4,000 kg or 4 metric tons. That's a lot of\nweight! To support this heft, its legs must be as thick as tree trunks\nto keep that huge bulk aloft.\n\nOn the other hand, a spider is much smaller than a hippopotamus.[^10.1.1] If\nthe radius of a daddy long legs spider is 1 mm (0.001 m), then its\nvolume is $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 $\\times 10^{-9}$ m$^3$ and its mass\nis $\\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}4 mg. Given this small mass, it is no wonder\nthat spiders can get away with having such skinny legs! Nevertheless, if\na spider were simply embiggened to have the same 1 m radius as the\nhippo, its legs would still be comically thin, and the poor spider would\ncollapse under its own weight.\n\nThe reason is that the strength of a bone (or muscle, in fact) increases\nmore slowly with its size than does the weight. Specifically, the\nstrength of a bone/muscle scales in proportion to its cross sectional\narea. (The cross sectional area of the muscle is taken to be\nperpendicular to its axis of contraction or extension.) For a muscle\napproximated as a cylinder (we like making these simple approximations\nto make life easier), this area is equal to $\\pi R^2$. So, if you scale\nup a spider, its weight increases with $R^3$ while the strength of each\nleg increases only with $R^2$. Note, again, that this strength-to-weight\nscaling law is also purely a mathematical effect; it is completely\nignorant of the molecular or structural details that give rise to the\nstrength of an object. The relationship certainly doesn't know anything\nabout the mechanism of how muscles operate. The same scaling law applies\nwhen designing furniture or skyscrapers: bigger things need thicker\nlegs.\n\nOf course, by creating composite materials made of long nanostructures\nwhose lengths are arranged parallel to the axis of loading, we can cheat\na little bit. If you have ever been to San Francisco and visited the\nGolden Gate Bridge,[^10.1.2] there is a monument consisting of the cross\nsection of one of the huge cables from which the bridge is suspended.\nThe striking thing about this cross section is that the cable is made of\nnearly 30 thousand little cables, each one of which was strengthened by\ndrawing during processing of the metal. Such strengthening would have\nbeen impossible to achieve if the cable---whose full diameter is almost\n1 m---were made using one huge solid chunk of metal. Not only would it\nbe nearly impossible to manufacture, but it would be much weaker.\nMoreover, a single defect might easily compromise the integrity of the\nentire structure. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for a busy\nbridge, but is entirely avoided in a composite cable.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge is quite geriatric, the use of composite\nmaterials pervades modern technology. For example, carbon composite\nplastic materials contain **carbon fibers**. These fibers are made from\nconventional polymeric fibers whose non-carbon atoms have been blasted\noff using heat in an inert atmosphere. What results is a graphitic\nstructure (think graphene or carbon nanotubes) which when placed in a\npolymer such as epoxy or nylon can increase the strength by several\norders of magnitude. Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers thus have among\nthe best strength-to-weight ratios of any engineered materials. Thus,\nwhile we cannot escape the mathematical inevitability of the poor\nstrength of materials with small cross sections, we can definitely work\nwithin its constraints to engineer materials with greatly increased\nstrength. These examples illustrate the importance of the internal\nstructure of materials in determining its bulk properties. After all,\nyou would never make the girders for a skyscraper out of eggshells.\n\n[^10.1.1]: And to think you PAID for this book!\n\n[^10.1.2]: One of the most beautiful human-made structures ever placed in an\n    already beautiful natural location.\n",
