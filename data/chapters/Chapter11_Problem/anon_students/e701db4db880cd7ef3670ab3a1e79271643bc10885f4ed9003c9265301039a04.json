The Graphite functions as the anode with lithium metal spread between the graphene sheets, where they are oxidized and provide their electrons. Graphite's structure allows the lithium metal ions to also fill in between its gaps easily, since it is naturally spaced, without other nearby charges.  Since lithium is being both oxidized and reduced, there is not much volume expansion occurring, so both electrodes contain overall static structures that lithium can move between in different forms.",
