      "content": "#### Section 1: The global economy depends on nanoengineering\nMany learners become interested in nanoengineering because of an\ninterest in environmental remediation and the production and storage of\nclean energy. Many of the nanoscale materials and phenomena we have\nexplored in this book are directly relevant to devices and processes\nused for the production and use of energy. This chapter provides two\ncase studies for the use of nanoscale materials which already have huge\nworldwide markets: catalysis and electrochemical energy storage in the\nform of batteries. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/fTv2em562tI)\n\nYou might have elected to take a class in---or major in---nanotechnology\nwith only a partial notion of the importance of this field in the modern\neconomy, and indeed in society. As we have seen so far in this book,\nnanoscale phenomena are responsible for a range of behaviors observed in\nboth biotic and abiotic environments. Moreover, physical effects arising\nfrom the effects of size confinement are being discovered regularly and\nare often harnessed in new technologies. Many of these technologies,\nincluding thin-film solar cells and nanoparticles for drug delivery,\nhold much promise for the future. However, technologies in two distinct\nareas---catalysts for chemical manufacturing and environmental\nremediation, along with materials for batteries---have already\nrevolutionized society in ways deemed unimaginable decades ago.\n",
