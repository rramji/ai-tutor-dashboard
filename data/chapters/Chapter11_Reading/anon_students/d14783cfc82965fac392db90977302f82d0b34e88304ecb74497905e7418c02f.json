      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",
