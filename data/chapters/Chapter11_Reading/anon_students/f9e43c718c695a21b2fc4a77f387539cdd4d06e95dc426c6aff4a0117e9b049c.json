      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Batteries\nA future society based on abundant, renewable energy sources such as\nfrom wind and solar require a place to store the energy once it is\ngenerated. The reason that storage is needed is that these sources are\nintermittent. The wind isn't always blowing and the sun is really only\nat its brightest from around 10 am to 4 pm. In contrast, fossil fuels\nsuch as coal and natural gas can be burned whenever. Their physical form\nsolves the storage issue automatically. Thus, we need to find a way to\nbuffer electricity demand during the times in which energy from wind and\nsolar is not being generated.[^11.3.1] Many potential solutions have been\nproposed, such as pumping water \"uphill\" or into dams and then releasing\nit after the sun goes down to generate \"on demand\" hydroelectric power.\nIndeed, this approach is gaining traction. Other solutions involve\nconverting excess energy generated during windy and sunny times into\nchemical fuels, such as hydrogen, which when burned in an engine or\n**fuel cell**[^11.3.2] can be used to generate electricity. However, perhaps\nthe most attractive mechanism for portable energy storage is by\nmanipulating electrochemical potentials. That is, batteries. Modern\nbattery technologies, exemplified in the now-ubiquitous lithium ion\ntype, are full of examples of nanoengineered systems. We examine the\nbasics, below.\n\n### 11.3.1. Operation of batteries\n\nA battery operates by manipulating the natural tendencies of some atoms,\nmolecules, or materials to want to give up electrons and the tendencies\nof other materials to accept these electrons. Those species which give\nup electrons are said to be **oxidized** in the process, while those\nthat accept electrons are said to be **reduced**.[^11.3.3] When electrons\nflow from one **half cell** to the other, when connected by a wire, the\nelectrochemical potential can be captured to power a load. The battery\nstops working when the two half cells are at thermodynamic equilibrium,\nand there is no longer any tendency for electrons to go from one\nmaterial to the other. We explore the operation of a battery in more\ndetail, below.\n\n#### Definitions\n\nA battery comprises two **half-cells**---an oxidation half-cell and a\nreduction half-cell. The oxidation half-cell consists of a material with\na strong tendency to give up electrons and the reduction half-cell is a\nmaterial that accepts these electrons. You may have heard the terms\n**anode** and **cathode**. The anode is the site of oxidation and the\ncathode is the site of reduction.[^11.3.4] The anode is thus the negatively\ncharged electrode and the cathode is the positively charged one.[^11.3.5] The\nquintessential battery consists of one or more **galvanic cells**. A\ngalvanic or voltaic cell consists of two elemental metals with different\noxidation potentials. These metal **electrodes** are immersed in\nseparate beakers in **electrolyte solution**. The electrodes are\nconnected to a voltmeter or **load** (like a light bulb) using a wire.\nThe beakers are connected using a **salt bridge** which can be, for\nexample, a glass tube filled with a **hydrogel** saturated with a\nsolution of an inert salt.\n\nThe classic example of a galvanic cell has a zinc anode and a copper\ncathode. The oxidation half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-}$$\n\nAnd the reduction half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-} = \\text{Cu}^0$$\n\nFor an overall reaction of\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + \\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Cu}^0 + \\text{Zn}^{2+}$$\n\nOnce this system is in place, electrons flow from the zinc (which wants\nto be oxidized) to the wire, through the load, to the copper (which\nwants to be reduced). Charge neutrality must be maintained, otherwise a\nhuge excess of positive charge would build up at the anodic half cell\nand vice versa. The system maintains charge neutrality by the drift of\nions through the salt bridge. In the example drawn in Figure (11.8), the\nions that migrate are sulfate.\n\n(Figure 11.8) \n>>>image(zinc-copper.png.0)\n\nThe voltage of the cell can be determined by summing up the oxidation\npotentials of the two half reactions. The electrochemical potential\nenergies of metals is tabulated in the form of the **reduction\npotential**, not the oxidation potential. Thus the potential energy of\nthe whole cell is given by\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$$\n\nIn this case, the standard reduction potential of zinc is -0.76 V and\nthe standard reduction potential of copper is 0.34 V. The total\npotential of the galvanic cell is thus 1.10 V. When we say *standard*\nreduction potential, we are making a reference to the **standard\nhydrogen electrode**, which involves the reaction of two protons with\ntwo electrons to form H$_2$, or hydrogen gas.\n\n#### Key figures of merit: Power and energy\n\nIn modern technology, you may sometimes hear, in jest, the mantra\n*better, faster, cheaper!*. For battery technologies, you could be a bit\nmore specific, and say *more energy density, more power density, safer,\nlighter, and more earth-abundant*. There are other key figures of merit\nas well.\n\n**Energy density** refers to the total amount of potential energy that\ncan be stored in the electrochemical cells per unit mass. It is the\ntotal capacity of the battery. For example, the lithium-ion batteries\ninside electric vehicles might have a total capacity of 100\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) or 360 megajoules (MJ).[^11.3.6] The capacity of the\nbattery in your phone is closer to 0.01 kWh.[^11.3.7]\n\n**Power density** refers to the speed at which the energy can be\nextracted from the battery. Power, in terms of watts, or joules per\nsecond, is dependent on the molecular level processes occurring in the\nelectrochemical cells. That is, oxidation and reduction at the\nelectrodes, along with transport and diffusion of electrons and ions\nbetween the two half-cells.\n\nThe energy and power densities are often expressed in terms of\n**specific energy** and **specific power** in units of J kg$^{-1}$ or W\nkg$^{-1}$. Note that these densities are per mass (gravimetric) not per\nvolume (volumetric). The specific energies and the specific powers for\nenergy storage devices are often regarded to be in competition. For\nexample, a capacitor can deliver power very quickly (think of a camera\nflash), but cannot store very much energy because it can only hold a\nthin layer of charge at the surface of metallic films. Alternatively, a\nfuel cell which converts hydrogen to electricity discharges very slowly\nbut has a ton of potential energy stored in its chemical bonds (i.e., of\nH$_2$). A convenient way to visualize the energy density and power\ndensity is the Ragone (rah-GO-nee) plot, see Figure (11.9).\n\n(Figure 11.9) \n>>>image(ragone.png.0)\n\nDespite the strong correlation between specific energy and specific\npower, there is still room for optimization. Much of this latitude is\nafforded by, you guessed it, nanoengineering of the electrode materials.\nWe look at the special case of lithium ion batteries, below.\n\n### 11.3.2. Lithium-ion batteries: materials selection\n\nLithium ion batteries operate by the movement of lithium ions (Li$^+$)\nand electrons (e$^-$) between two half cells. One half cell, the anode,\ncontains graphite and lithium atoms (Li$^0$). The other half cell, the\ncathode, contains lithium metal (often cobalt) oxide (see Figure\n(11.10)). The two half cells are separated by a membrane electrolyte\nwhich is permeable to lithium ions. In normal operation, when the cells\nare fully charged, the lithium metal atoms on the anode side give up\ntheir electrons. The graphite is connected to a copper film, which\nitself is connected to a wire. The electron exits the anode into the\ncopper film and thence to a wire, where the current flow can be used to\npower an electrical load. Meanwhile, the lithium ions traverse the\nelectrolyte **separator** to the cathode half-cell. The cathode\nhalf-cell consists of an **intercalation compound**, of which the\narchetype is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO$_2$). The cathode is supported\nby a film of metal, typically aluminum. The electrons---after passing\nthrough the wire connecting the two half cells---enter the cathode and\nreduce the lithium ions back to lithium metal. When the battery is\n(re)charged, a positive bias is applied to the cathode. Electrons leave\nthe lithium metal and the lithium ions that are created migrate back\nover to the anode and take up residence between the graphene sheets of\nthe graphite anode.\n\n(Figure 11.10) \n>>>image(lithium ion.png.0)\n\n#### Anodes\n\nThe graphene sheets that make up the graphite are the perfect home for\nthe small lithium atoms. Recall that in a classical galvanic cell, the\nmetal ions either detach upon oxidation or deposit by reduction onto the\nelectrodes themselves. The metal electrodes either shrink or increase in\nmass, depending on the direction of the flow of current. It is actually\nthe negatively charged counterion in the electrolyte solution that\nmigrates via the salt bridge to balance the excess of charge. In a\nlithium-ion battery, the solid electrodes consist of graphite and\nlithium cobalt oxide. Both materials are able to accommodate lithium\nspecies within their solid structures. Thus, these materials can be\ndischarged and charged again while the changes to their structures are\nnominally reversible.\n\nDespite its popularity as an anode material, graphite has a somewhat low\nspecific capacity, owing to its low volumetric change upon lithiation.\nIn contrast, silicon can undergo a very large increase in volume\n(5$\\times$) and thus accommodate many more lithium atoms. Challenges to\nthe use of silicon anodes are indeed related to this large and\nreversible volumetric change. This cycling in size can lead to cracking,\nand thus polymeric binders that are permeable to ions must be\nengineered. Nevertheless, silicon anodes are used in the commercial\nmarket, with increased specific charge associated with, for example,\ngreater range in electric vehicles.\n\n#### Cathodes\n\nThe conventional cathode of lithium cobalt oxide is known as an\n**intercalation compound**, which means that some species---in this case\nlithium atoms---can slide into the crystal structure. These materials\nare selected for various applications on the basis of either total\ncapacity of charge storage or the speed with which the charges can be\nextracted. For example, while cathodes based on lithium cobalt oxide\nmight be the best for relatively low-power devices like smartphones and\nlaptops, they may not be the best for electric vehicles, which require a\nlot of power quickly. Researchers are constantly looking for new types\nof intercalation compounds that can shuttle ions in and out of their\ncrystal structures quickly.\n\n### 11.3.3. Case study: electric vehicles\n\nIndeed the ability to move lithium ions and atoms in and out of the\nelectrodes is hugely important for the electrification of the economy.\nMuch of the energy usage associated with carbon emissions and thus\nglobal climate change comes through the transportation sector of the\neconomy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take a majority of the\nmarket share of new vehicles sold in the United States by around\n2030-2035. The expectation of huge growth is supported by (1)\nenvironmental regulation, (2) consumer tax incentives, and (3) the fact\nthat many aspects of ownership of EVs are superior to those of vehicles\npowered by an **internal combustion engine (ICE)**. The electrification\nof the transportation sector of the economy is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of strategies for the electrochemical storage of\nenergy---i.e., batteries. As you know, batteries have been used in\nautomobiles for many decades. Headlights, radios, and power windows have\nalways required electricity. Nevertheless, the movement of vehicles\nweighing thousands of pounds over ranges of hundreds of miles has\nrequired the development of new types of battery technologies.\n\n#### Oldie but goodie: The lead-acid battery\n\nVehicles have had electrical components for around a century.\nHeadlights, indoor lighting, audio equipment, and operation of the\ninstrument clusters use a **lead-acid** battery (starting, lighting, and\nignition, the \"SLI\" tasks). The lead acid battery was invented in the\nmid-nineteenth century, and was the first **rechargeable** battery to be\ndiscovered. It may be surprising to learn that essentially all low\n(12-volt) applications in automobiles are still powered by the lead-acid\nbattery, and to this day this ancient technology represents around 50%\nof the market share of batteries sold in the world.\n\nA lead-acid battery consists of an elemental (i.e., metallic) lead\nelectrode separated by an electrolyte, sometimes a gel, containing\nsulfuric acid. The cathode consists of lead oxide (PbO$_2$). In\noperation, excess electrons travel from the metallic lead through an\nexternal wire to power the peripheral devices of the car. The lead oxide\nis reduced by the electrons returning to the cathode. During this\nreduction reaction, an oxygen ion (O$^{2-}$) is ejected. It quickly\npicks up two acidic hydrogen ions (protons) from the sulfuric acid, and\nbecomes water. The naked sulfate ion that is produced migrates through\nthe liquid or gel electrolyte to the anode, where the lead atoms that\nlost their two electrons combine with the sulfate to become lead\nsulfate. (Actually, both the anode and the cathode when fully discharged\nbecome lead sulfate.) The equilibration of the electrochemical\npotentials leads to a **dead battery**. The **alternator** of the car\nturns excess mechanical energy into electrical potential that is used to\nrecharge the battery.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the architecture of the lead acid battery as\na textbook galvanic cell with wires connected to thick slabs of lead and\nlead oxide separated by an electrolyte. In reality, however, a car\nbattery has a hierarchical structure. The anodes and cathodes are made\ninto thin plates covered by a nanoporous separator membrane that allows\nions through prevents contact and thus short circuiting of the\nelectrodes. Groups of plates are slid into place in an interdigitated\nstructure like two combs or the opposing sides of a zipper. In this\nstructure, the anode and cathode materials alternate. The purpose of\nthis structure is to increase the total surface area to permit facile\ncharging and discharging. The space between the interdigitated\nelectrodes is filled with an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Other\nstructures---e.g., concentric cylinders---are used for other\napplications.\n\nEach cell in a lead-acid battery has a nominal voltage of 2.1 V. To\nachieve a total voltage of 12 V, six of these cells are connected in\nseries, with the negative terminal (anode) of one cell connected to the\npositive terminal (cathode) of the next. The lead-acid battery is\ncapable of around 500 full discharge cycles before it must be replaced.\nThe finite lifetime of a lead-acid battery is the result of the\nformation of a crystallized form of lead sulfate that forms at both the\nanode and the cathode which, unlike amorphous lead sulfate, does not\nrevert back to the pure lead and lead oxide phases when recharged. Once\nthis unwanted process of **sulfation** is completed, the battery is\ndead.\n\n#### The lithium-ion \"traction\" battery\n\nAll hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric vehicles also have a\nlarger, more powerful battery on board. This is the so-called **traction\nbattery**, because it is used not to power the ignition and the\nrelatively low-power lights and peripherals in the passenger cabin, but\nthe wheels. The fact that electric vehicles even had two batteries for\ndifferent purposes was made strikingly clear to me on a recent camping\ntrip in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park near San Diego. In order to unload\nour food, drinks, tent, and other accessories, we left the lift gate of\nour plugin hybrid vehichle open, and didn't close it for several hours.\nUnbeknownst to me, the opening of the lift gate engaged all kinds of\nelectronic circuits in the inside of the car. I had believed that the 10\nkWh battery---half full at the time we parked---would make the phrase\n\"dead battery\" a thing of the past, at least for drivers of cars with\nbig lithium ion batteries. It turns out that this battery has a highly\nspecialized purpose, and that it is to power the wheels, and little\nelse. Apparently, the lead-acid battery needs to have charge even to\nturn the car on! By leaving the lift gate open, I had depleted the\nlead-acid battery and the car would not even start. Thankfully, we had a\n12-volt battery pack with us that we had purchased to jump a different\ncar left unused in our garage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had\nbrought this battery to charge our USB devices, and were able to use it\nto start the car.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, along with functionally equivalent\nlithium-polymer batteries (which use a polymeric electrolyte), have\nhigher energy densities than lead-acid batteries and also longer\nlifetimes. They can in general be discharged deeper with less\ndegradation in capacity. Traction batteries with capacities of 200 V can\nbe produced by combining many **cells** with nominal voltages of 3 to 4\nV in various arrangements into the **battery pack**. Lithium-ion\nbatteries are considered a technology of moderate maturity, which means\nthat there are many avenues for potential discovery and improvement.\n\n### 11.3.4. Areas for discovery\n\nBattery technologies---and in particular those based on the lithium-ion\nconcept---are still in a rich phase of research and development. Many\nuniversity and industrial laboratories are working to increase the power\ndensity, energy density, lifetime, safety, recyclability, and\nenvironmental burden of the components. Here, we highlight a few areas\nwhich represent potentially fruitful avenues which are receiving\nsignificant attention and research funding.\n\n#### The solid electrolyte interface\n\nOne of the chief reasons that a lithium-ion battery loses its capacity\nover its lifetime is because of unwanted reactions at the surface of the\nanode. These reactions occur because of the high reduction potential of\nthe anode and thus its ability to react with molecules within the\nelectrolyte. Eventually, this process leads to the formation of a crusty\nsubstance at the surface of the anode. This crust contains many types of\ncompounds and a composition and morphology that depends on the identity\nof the molecules in the electrolyte. This crust is called the **solid\nelectrolyte interface (SEI)**. The formation of the SEI is regarded as\ninevitable, but it is nevertheless the object of intense study.\nCharacterization of the compounds that form at the SEI and examination\nof the way in which the compounds within the battery influence its\nmorphology could lead to better selection of materials or architecture\nof the device. In particular, designs that slow the growth of the SEI or\nallow its growth to proceed in a more predictable manner are desirable.\n\nThere are several ways in which the SEI has undesirable consequences on\nthe performance of a lithium-ion battery over time. For example, as the\nanode reduces the molecules of the electrolyte---often carbonate\nsolvents---electron-rich products are formed. To balance the charge,\npositively charged lithium ions become incorporated in these products.\nThe formation of these lithium-containing compounds is irreversible and\nleads to a reduction in **lithium inventory** in the cell. Since lithium\natoms and ions are the currency of the battery, sequestration of lithium\nin the SEI is equivalent to taking money out of the economy by putting\nit under your mattress and then forgetting about it. Another way in\nwhich the SEI reduces the effectiveness of the battery is by blocking\nthe migration of lithium into and out of the anode. This characteristic\nof the SEI may reduce the power density. A final way in which the SEI\nacts to reduce the efficiency of the battery may be counterintuitive.\nThat is, the SEI may be electrically conductive. Greater conductivity of\nelectrons means a greater rate of unwanted electrochemical reduction of\nthe compounds making up the electrolyte. This increase leads to greater\ngrowth rate of the SEI, and thus a greater degradation of the\nelectrolyte, loss of lithium inventory, decreased rate of lithium\nexchange with the anode, and so on. Thus, understanding the composition\nof the SEI, its material properties, and methods to limit its formation\nare key to increased usage of lithium-ion batteries in transportation\nand grid-scale energy storage.\n\n#### Alternative anode materials\n\nGraphite has been the go-to anode material for its ability to house\nlithium atoms in between its layers of graphene sheets. However, the\ntheoretical capacity of graphite to store lithium is limited to a single\nlithium atom per six carbon atoms (LiC$_6$). This stoichiometry\ncorresponds to a specific charge capacity of 372 mAh g$^{-1}$, assuming\none electron per lithium atom. However, silicon has the ability to take\nup a substantially greater amount of lithium in its crystal structure,\nwith a maximum of nearly four lithium atoms per silicon atom\n(Li$_{3.75}$Si), and a specific capacity of 3,600 mAh g$^{-1}$. However,\nwith this ability to eat such large amounts of lithium, silicon gets\nbloated. The periodic volumetric expansion of the anode upon charging\nand discharging (up to 320% expansion) imposes significant mechanical\nstrains on the structure of the device. The silicon must be made into\nnanowires or nanoparticles in order to accommodate the volumetric\nexpansion without cracking, but changing the form factor of the silicon\nis not without its own challenges, as the \"breathing\" of these particles\nstill have the potential to disrupt the interior structure of the cell.\nAttempts to mitigate the volumetric expansion have included the use of\ncarbon containing binders between silicon nanoparticles to increase the\nmechanical stability, however cracking still occurs. Conductive polymers\nincorporated into gels which absorb the mechanical work energy\nassociated with lithiation of silicon have recently shown some success.\nThese polymeric and gel-like binders must obviously be conductive to\nlithium ions. This requirement imposes some additional constraints on\nwhat materials can be used. Despite these challenges, silicon anodes are\nhighly desirable, and an effective strategy is to split the difference\nbetween stability and charge capacity, and to use a mixture of graphite\nand silicon.\n\n#### Alternative cathode materials\n\nIn a lithium-ion battery, the anode and cathode have a similar function:\nto store lithium atoms (Li$^0$) or ions (Li$^{+}$), respectively. Such\nmaterials permit these lithium species to **intercalate** within their\ncrystal structures. The most well known intercalation compound for use\nas the cathode is lithium cobalt oxide. Compared to alternatives\nincluding lithium nickel oxide and nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxides,\nLiCoO$_2$ has a lower capacity for lithium ions, but is more stable at\nhigh-temperature operation. Unfortunately, it is still susceptible to\nrunaway oxidation of the electrolyte, which is highly exothermic, and\ncan lead to fires. Additionally, cobalt is known as a **conflict\nmineral**. Its extraction---much of which is performed in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo---is associated with resource conflict and\nenvironmental degradation. Moreover, some mining organizations have been\nfound to be in abuse of child labor. Alternative cathode materials are\nthus under intense investigation; the target being structures made from\nelements with greater natural abundance (e.g., manganese) and which are\nless susceptible to runaway oxidation and fires.\n\n#### Metal ions\n\nLithium has many advantages as a repository of electrons and for its\nability to intercalate into graphite, silicon, and intercalation\ncompounds used at the cathode. However, lithium is relatively rare\ncompared to other alkali metals, and ancillary metals used in lithium\nion batteries---primarily copper, cobalt, and nickel---suffer from high\ncost, scarcity, and other **negative externalities** of production.\nSodium-ion batteries operate on the same principle as their\nlithium-based counterparts, but with the advantage that sodium is\nubiquitous. Consider that the ocean---a staggeringly huge amount of\nliquid---is more than 1% sodium ions, by mass! One can immediately see\nwhy this small-continent amount of sodium would be so attractive for use\nin batteries.\n\nNevertheless, sodium is much larger than lithium, and thus it is more\ndifficult to achieve high energy densities with sodium than it is with\nlithium.[^11.3.8] The difference in size between sodium and lithium require\nthe use of different electrode materials. For example, instead of\ngraphite, the anode for sodium ion batteries often uses a different\nallotrope of carbon called **hard carbon**, i.e., charcoal. Hard carbon\nis produced by heating certain types of polymers, including **lignin**,\ncarbohydrates, and other precursors in the absence of oxygen at around\n1000 $^{\\circ}$ C. What results is a highly porous, amorphous material\nthat differentiates itself from other carbonaceous allotropes in that it\ncannot be converted to graphite.[^11.3.9] Hard carbon is capable of\nincorporating sodium ions into its structure. Transfer of sodium in and\nout of the solid is made easier by the fact that hard carbon is highly\nporous.\n\nAs in lithium-ion batteries, cathodic materials for their sodium-based\nalternatives also take the form of intercalation compounds. One of the\napparent advantages of sodium-ion technology is that the cathode\nmaterials have the potential to use metals other than cobalt or nickel.\nFor example, sodium metal oxides in which the metal is either iron or\nmanganese---highly earth-abundant compared to cobalt and nickel---have\ncapacities comparable to those of common cathodes used in lithium-ion\nbatteries.\n\n[^11.3.1]: At the time of this writing, a major breakthrough was achieved in\n    the production of energy by fusion. However, most experts agree that\n    it will take quite a long time for such methods of energy production\n    to become widespread.\n\n[^11.3.2]: A fuel cell takes in a chemical fuel, e.g., hydrogen, and outputs\n    electricity and water vapor.\n\n[^11.3.3]: This naming convention between oxidation and reduction, frankly,\n    always annoyed me. The physical particle changing hands is an\n    electron, which has mass, so why would a species be \"reduced\" in any\n    way by accepting additional mass? The reason is that humans probably\n    didn't know that the negative charge was the one that actually had\n    physical mass, i.e., the electron, and that the positive charge was\n    simply the absence of this electron. \"Reduction\" comes from the fact\n    that the charge gets reduced from positive to less positive (or more\n    negative). \"Oxidation\" comes from the fact that when atoms get\n    oxygen atoms attached to them, the highly electronegative oxygen\n    atoms draw electron density away and thus the atoms to which the\n    oxygens are attached become more positive.\n\n[^11.3.4]: If you want, you can use the mnemonic \"Annie the ox\" and \"Cathy\n    the red cat.\"\n\n[^11.3.5]: I tend to think of the \"t\" in *cathode* as a positive sign, and\n    thus I remember which is which. Keep in mind however that in a solar\n    cell, the positive charges come out at the anode. The best way to\n    reconcile this apparent contradiction is that the anode is always\n    the electrode where *conventional*---i.e., positive---current enters\n    the device *most easily*. Consider large forward biases where the\n    current gets really high at positive voltages. In a solar cell, this\n    is positive current entering the anode. If you don't want to think\n    about any of this stuff, just memorize them separately: in a\n    battery, anode is negative; in a solar cell, it is positive. Sorry!\n\n[^11.3.6]: The unusual unit of kilowatt-hours means that there is enough\n    potential energy in the battery to run 100 kW worth of electrical\n    load for 1 h. Granted, the battery may not be able to discharge that\n    fast, but that's the energy capacity assuming you could. It could\n    also power 1 kW worth of electrical load over 100 h. However you\n    want to think about it. That is equivalent to running a hair dryer\n    or toaster oven for 4 days straight.\n\n[^11.3.7]: For some reason, small batteries are rated in terms of current\n    $\\times$ time. The value of 0.01 kWh is derived from a 2 ampere-hour\n    (2000 mAh) battery discharging at a potential difference of 5 V.\n\n[^11.3.8]: Note that whether the atom is lithium or sodium otherwise makes no\n    difference: both have a single ionizable electron and can be\n    oxidized only one time.\n\n[^11.3.9]: A different range of precursors, including fossilized coal or oil,\n    is heated in the absence of oxygen to generate **soft carbon**, or\n    *coke*, which can be further converted to graphite.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Batteries\nA future society based on abundant, renewable energy sources such as\nfrom wind and solar require a place to store the energy once it is\ngenerated. The reason that storage is needed is that these sources are\nintermittent. The wind isn't always blowing and the sun is really only\nat its brightest from around 10 am to 4 pm. In contrast, fossil fuels\nsuch as coal and natural gas can be burned whenever. Their physical form\nsolves the storage issue automatically. Thus, we need to find a way to\nbuffer electricity demand during the times in which energy from wind and\nsolar is not being generated.[^11.3.1] Many potential solutions have been\nproposed, such as pumping water \"uphill\" or into dams and then releasing\nit after the sun goes down to generate \"on demand\" hydroelectric power.\nIndeed, this approach is gaining traction. Other solutions involve\nconverting excess energy generated during windy and sunny times into\nchemical fuels, such as hydrogen, which when burned in an engine or\n**fuel cell**[^11.3.2] can be used to generate electricity. However, perhaps\nthe most attractive mechanism for portable energy storage is by\nmanipulating electrochemical potentials. That is, batteries. Modern\nbattery technologies, exemplified in the now-ubiquitous lithium ion\ntype, are full of examples of nanoengineered systems. We examine the\nbasics, below.\n\n### 11.3.1. Operation of batteries\n\nA battery operates by manipulating the natural tendencies of some atoms,\nmolecules, or materials to want to give up electrons and the tendencies\nof other materials to accept these electrons. Those species which give\nup electrons are said to be **oxidized** in the process, while those\nthat accept electrons are said to be **reduced**.[^11.3.3] When electrons\nflow from one **half cell** to the other, when connected by a wire, the\nelectrochemical potential can be captured to power a load. The battery\nstops working when the two half cells are at thermodynamic equilibrium,\nand there is no longer any tendency for electrons to go from one\nmaterial to the other. We explore the operation of a battery in more\ndetail, below.\n\n#### Definitions\n\nA battery comprises two **half-cells**---an oxidation half-cell and a\nreduction half-cell. The oxidation half-cell consists of a material with\na strong tendency to give up electrons and the reduction half-cell is a\nmaterial that accepts these electrons. You may have heard the terms\n**anode** and **cathode**. The anode is the site of oxidation and the\ncathode is the site of reduction.[^11.3.4] The anode is thus the negatively\ncharged electrode and the cathode is the positively charged one.[^11.3.5] The\nquintessential battery consists of one or more **galvanic cells**. A\ngalvanic or voltaic cell consists of two elemental metals with different\noxidation potentials. These metal **electrodes** are immersed in\nseparate beakers in **electrolyte solution**. The electrodes are\nconnected to a voltmeter or **load** (like a light bulb) using a wire.\nThe beakers are connected using a **salt bridge** which can be, for\nexample, a glass tube filled with a **hydrogel** saturated with a\nsolution of an inert salt.\n\nThe classic example of a galvanic cell has a zinc anode and a copper\ncathode. The oxidation half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-}$$\n\nAnd the reduction half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-} = \\text{Cu}^0$$\n\nFor an overall reaction of\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + \\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Cu}^0 + \\text{Zn}^{2+}$$\n\nOnce this system is in place, electrons flow from the zinc (which wants\nto be oxidized) to the wire, through the load, to the copper (which\nwants to be reduced). Charge neutrality must be maintained, otherwise a\nhuge excess of positive charge would build up at the anodic half cell\nand vice versa. The system maintains charge neutrality by the drift of\nions through the salt bridge. In the example drawn in Figure (11.8), the\nions that migrate are sulfate.\n\n(Figure 11.8) \n>>>image(zinc-copper.png.0)\n\nThe voltage of the cell can be determined by summing up the oxidation\npotentials of the two half reactions. The electrochemical potential\nenergies of metals is tabulated in the form of the **reduction\npotential**, not the oxidation potential. Thus the potential energy of\nthe whole cell is given by\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$$\n\nIn this case, the standard reduction potential of zinc is -0.76 V and\nthe standard reduction potential of copper is 0.34 V. The total\npotential of the galvanic cell is thus 1.10 V. When we say *standard*\nreduction potential, we are making a reference to the **standard\nhydrogen electrode**, which involves the reaction of two protons with\ntwo electrons to form H$_2$, or hydrogen gas.\n\n#### Key figures of merit: Power and energy\n\nIn modern technology, you may sometimes hear, in jest, the mantra\n*better, faster, cheaper!*. For battery technologies, you could be a bit\nmore specific, and say *more energy density, more power density, safer,\nlighter, and more earth-abundant*. There are other key figures of merit\nas well.\n\n**Energy density** refers to the total amount of potential energy that\ncan be stored in the electrochemical cells per unit mass. It is the\ntotal capacity of the battery. For example, the lithium-ion batteries\ninside electric vehicles might have a total capacity of 100\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) or 360 megajoules (MJ).[^11.3.6] The capacity of the\nbattery in your phone is closer to 0.01 kWh.[^11.3.7]\n\n**Power density** refers to the speed at which the energy can be\nextracted from the battery. Power, in terms of watts, or joules per\nsecond, is dependent on the molecular level processes occurring in the\nelectrochemical cells. That is, oxidation and reduction at the\nelectrodes, along with transport and diffusion of electrons and ions\nbetween the two half-cells.\n\nThe energy and power densities are often expressed in terms of\n**specific energy** and **specific power** in units of J kg$^{-1}$ or W\nkg$^{-1}$. Note that these densities are per mass (gravimetric) not per\nvolume (volumetric). The specific energies and the specific powers for\nenergy storage devices are often regarded to be in competition. For\nexample, a capacitor can deliver power very quickly (think of a camera\nflash), but cannot store very much energy because it can only hold a\nthin layer of charge at the surface of metallic films. Alternatively, a\nfuel cell which converts hydrogen to electricity discharges very slowly\nbut has a ton of potential energy stored in its chemical bonds (i.e., of\nH$_2$). A convenient way to visualize the energy density and power\ndensity is the Ragone (rah-GO-nee) plot, see Figure (11.9).\n\n(Figure 11.9) \n>>>image(ragone.png.0)\n\nDespite the strong correlation between specific energy and specific\npower, there is still room for optimization. Much of this latitude is\nafforded by, you guessed it, nanoengineering of the electrode materials.\nWe look at the special case of lithium ion batteries, below.\n\n### 11.3.2. Lithium-ion batteries: materials selection\n\nLithium ion batteries operate by the movement of lithium ions (Li$^+$)\nand electrons (e$^-$) between two half cells. One half cell, the anode,\ncontains graphite and lithium atoms (Li$^0$). The other half cell, the\ncathode, contains lithium metal (often cobalt) oxide (see Figure\n(11.10)). The two half cells are separated by a membrane electrolyte\nwhich is permeable to lithium ions. In normal operation, when the cells\nare fully charged, the lithium metal atoms on the anode side give up\ntheir electrons. The graphite is connected to a copper film, which\nitself is connected to a wire. The electron exits the anode into the\ncopper film and thence to a wire, where the current flow can be used to\npower an electrical load. Meanwhile, the lithium ions traverse the\nelectrolyte **separator** to the cathode half-cell. The cathode\nhalf-cell consists of an **intercalation compound**, of which the\narchetype is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO$_2$). The cathode is supported\nby a film of metal, typically aluminum. The electrons---after passing\nthrough the wire connecting the two half cells---enter the cathode and\nreduce the lithium ions back to lithium metal. When the battery is\n(re)charged, a positive bias is applied to the cathode. Electrons leave\nthe lithium metal and the lithium ions that are created migrate back\nover to the anode and take up residence between the graphene sheets of\nthe graphite anode.\n\n(Figure 11.10) \n>>>image(lithium ion.png.0)\n\n#### Anodes\n\nThe graphene sheets that make up the graphite are the perfect home for\nthe small lithium atoms. Recall that in a classical galvanic cell, the\nmetal ions either detach upon oxidation or deposit by reduction onto the\nelectrodes themselves. The metal electrodes either shrink or increase in\nmass, depending on the direction of the flow of current. It is actually\nthe negatively charged counterion in the electrolyte solution that\nmigrates via the salt bridge to balance the excess of charge. In a\nlithium-ion battery, the solid electrodes consist of graphite and\nlithium cobalt oxide. Both materials are able to accommodate lithium\nspecies within their solid structures. Thus, these materials can be\ndischarged and charged again while the changes to their structures are\nnominally reversible.\n\nDespite its popularity as an anode material, graphite has a somewhat low\nspecific capacity, owing to its low volumetric change upon lithiation.\nIn contrast, silicon can undergo a very large increase in volume\n(5$\\times$) and thus accommodate many more lithium atoms. Challenges to\nthe use of silicon anodes are indeed related to this large and\nreversible volumetric change. This cycling in size can lead to cracking,\nand thus polymeric binders that are permeable to ions must be\nengineered. Nevertheless, silicon anodes are used in the commercial\nmarket, with increased specific charge associated with, for example,\ngreater range in electric vehicles.\n\n#### Cathodes\n\nThe conventional cathode of lithium cobalt oxide is known as an\n**intercalation compound**, which means that some species---in this case\nlithium atoms---can slide into the crystal structure. These materials\nare selected for various applications on the basis of either total\ncapacity of charge storage or the speed with which the charges can be\nextracted. For example, while cathodes based on lithium cobalt oxide\nmight be the best for relatively low-power devices like smartphones and\nlaptops, they may not be the best for electric vehicles, which require a\nlot of power quickly. Researchers are constantly looking for new types\nof intercalation compounds that can shuttle ions in and out of their\ncrystal structures quickly.\n\n### 11.3.3. Case study: electric vehicles\n\nIndeed the ability to move lithium ions and atoms in and out of the\nelectrodes is hugely important for the electrification of the economy.\nMuch of the energy usage associated with carbon emissions and thus\nglobal climate change comes through the transportation sector of the\neconomy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take a majority of the\nmarket share of new vehicles sold in the United States by around\n2030-2035. The expectation of huge growth is supported by (1)\nenvironmental regulation, (2) consumer tax incentives, and (3) the fact\nthat many aspects of ownership of EVs are superior to those of vehicles\npowered by an **internal combustion engine (ICE)**. The electrification\nof the transportation sector of the economy is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of strategies for the electrochemical storage of\nenergy---i.e., batteries. As you know, batteries have been used in\nautomobiles for many decades. Headlights, radios, and power windows have\nalways required electricity. Nevertheless, the movement of vehicles\nweighing thousands of pounds over ranges of hundreds of miles has\nrequired the development of new types of battery technologies.\n\n#### Oldie but goodie: The lead-acid battery\n\nVehicles have had electrical components for around a century.\nHeadlights, indoor lighting, audio equipment, and operation of the\ninstrument clusters use a **lead-acid** battery (starting, lighting, and\nignition, the \"SLI\" tasks). The lead acid battery was invented in the\nmid-nineteenth century, and was the first **rechargeable** battery to be\ndiscovered. It may be surprising to learn that essentially all low\n(12-volt) applications in automobiles are still powered by the lead-acid\nbattery, and to this day this ancient technology represents around 50%\nof the market share of batteries sold in the world.\n\nA lead-acid battery consists of an elemental (i.e., metallic) lead\nelectrode separated by an electrolyte, sometimes a gel, containing\nsulfuric acid. The cathode consists of lead oxide (PbO$_2$). In\noperation, excess electrons travel from the metallic lead through an\nexternal wire to power the peripheral devices of the car. The lead oxide\nis reduced by the electrons returning to the cathode. During this\nreduction reaction, an oxygen ion (O$^{2-}$) is ejected. It quickly\npicks up two acidic hydrogen ions (protons) from the sulfuric acid, and\nbecomes water. The naked sulfate ion that is produced migrates through\nthe liquid or gel electrolyte to the anode, where the lead atoms that\nlost their two electrons combine with the sulfate to become lead\nsulfate. (Actually, both the anode and the cathode when fully discharged\nbecome lead sulfate.) The equilibration of the electrochemical\npotentials leads to a **dead battery**. The **alternator** of the car\nturns excess mechanical energy into electrical potential that is used to\nrecharge the battery.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the architecture of the lead acid battery as\na textbook galvanic cell with wires connected to thick slabs of lead and\nlead oxide separated by an electrolyte. In reality, however, a car\nbattery has a hierarchical structure. The anodes and cathodes are made\ninto thin plates covered by a nanoporous separator membrane that allows\nions through prevents contact and thus short circuiting of the\nelectrodes. Groups of plates are slid into place in an interdigitated\nstructure like two combs or the opposing sides of a zipper. In this\nstructure, the anode and cathode materials alternate. The purpose of\nthis structure is to increase the total surface area to permit facile\ncharging and discharging. The space between the interdigitated\nelectrodes is filled with an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Other\nstructures---e.g., concentric cylinders---are used for other\napplications.\n\nEach cell in a lead-acid battery has a nominal voltage of 2.1 V. To\nachieve a total voltage of 12 V, six of these cells are connected in\nseries, with the negative terminal (anode) of one cell connected to the\npositive terminal (cathode) of the next. The lead-acid battery is\ncapable of around 500 full discharge cycles before it must be replaced.\nThe finite lifetime of a lead-acid battery is the result of the\nformation of a crystallized form of lead sulfate that forms at both the\nanode and the cathode which, unlike amorphous lead sulfate, does not\nrevert back to the pure lead and lead oxide phases when recharged. Once\nthis unwanted process of **sulfation** is completed, the battery is\ndead.\n\n#### The lithium-ion \"traction\" battery\n\nAll hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric vehicles also have a\nlarger, more powerful battery on board. This is the so-called **traction\nbattery**, because it is used not to power the ignition and the\nrelatively low-power lights and peripherals in the passenger cabin, but\nthe wheels. The fact that electric vehicles even had two batteries for\ndifferent purposes was made strikingly clear to me on a recent camping\ntrip in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park near San Diego. In order to unload\nour food, drinks, tent, and other accessories, we left the lift gate of\nour plugin hybrid vehichle open, and didn't close it for several hours.\nUnbeknownst to me, the opening of the lift gate engaged all kinds of\nelectronic circuits in the inside of the car. I had believed that the 10\nkWh battery---half full at the time we parked---would make the phrase\n\"dead battery\" a thing of the past, at least for drivers of cars with\nbig lithium ion batteries. It turns out that this battery has a highly\nspecialized purpose, and that it is to power the wheels, and little\nelse. Apparently, the lead-acid battery needs to have charge even to\nturn the car on! By leaving the lift gate open, I had depleted the\nlead-acid battery and the car would not even start. Thankfully, we had a\n12-volt battery pack with us that we had purchased to jump a different\ncar left unused in our garage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had\nbrought this battery to charge our USB devices, and were able to use it\nto start the car.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, along with functionally equivalent\nlithium-polymer batteries (which use a polymeric electrolyte), have\nhigher energy densities than lead-acid batteries and also longer\nlifetimes. They can in general be discharged deeper with less\ndegradation in capacity. Traction batteries with capacities of 200 V can\nbe produced by combining many **cells** with nominal voltages of 3 to 4\nV in various arrangements into the **battery pack**. Lithium-ion\nbatteries are considered a technology of moderate maturity, which means\nthat there are many avenues for potential discovery and improvement.\n\n### 11.3.4. Areas for discovery\n\nBattery technologies---and in particular those based on the lithium-ion\nconcept---are still in a rich phase of research and development. Many\nuniversity and industrial laboratories are working to increase the power\ndensity, energy density, lifetime, safety, recyclability, and\nenvironmental burden of the components. Here, we highlight a few areas\nwhich represent potentially fruitful avenues which are receiving\nsignificant attention and research funding.\n\n#### The solid electrolyte interface\n\nOne of the chief reasons that a lithium-ion battery loses its capacity\nover its lifetime is because of unwanted reactions at the surface of the\nanode. These reactions occur because of the high reduction potential of\nthe anode and thus its ability to react with molecules within the\nelectrolyte. Eventually, this process leads to the formation of a crusty\nsubstance at the surface of the anode. This crust contains many types of\ncompounds and a composition and morphology that depends on the identity\nof the molecules in the electrolyte. This crust is called the **solid\nelectrolyte interface (SEI)**. The formation of the SEI is regarded as\ninevitable, but it is nevertheless the object of intense study.\nCharacterization of the compounds that form at the SEI and examination\nof the way in which the compounds within the battery influence its\nmorphology could lead to better selection of materials or architecture\nof the device. In particular, designs that slow the growth of the SEI or\nallow its growth to proceed in a more predictable manner are desirable.\n\nThere are several ways in which the SEI has undesirable consequences on\nthe performance of a lithium-ion battery over time. For example, as the\nanode reduces the molecules of the electrolyte---often carbonate\nsolvents---electron-rich products are formed. To balance the charge,\npositively charged lithium ions become incorporated in these products.\nThe formation of these lithium-containing compounds is irreversible and\nleads to a reduction in **lithium inventory** in the cell. Since lithium\natoms and ions are the currency of the battery, sequestration of lithium\nin the SEI is equivalent to taking money out of the economy by putting\nit under your mattress and then forgetting about it. Another way in\nwhich the SEI reduces the effectiveness of the battery is by blocking\nthe migration of lithium into and out of the anode. This characteristic\nof the SEI may reduce the power density. A final way in which the SEI\nacts to reduce the efficiency of the battery may be counterintuitive.\nThat is, the SEI may be electrically conductive. Greater conductivity of\nelectrons means a greater rate of unwanted electrochemical reduction of\nthe compounds making up the electrolyte. This increase leads to greater\ngrowth rate of the SEI, and thus a greater degradation of the\nelectrolyte, loss of lithium inventory, decreased rate of lithium\nexchange with the anode, and so on. Thus, understanding the composition\nof the SEI, its material properties, and methods to limit its formation\nare key to increased usage of lithium-ion batteries in transportation\nand grid-scale energy storage.\n\n#### Alternative anode materials\n\nGraphite has been the go-to anode material for its ability to house\nlithium atoms in between its layers of graphene sheets. However, the\ntheoretical capacity of graphite to store lithium is limited to a single\nlithium atom per six carbon atoms (LiC$_6$). This stoichiometry\ncorresponds to a specific charge capacity of 372 mAh g$^{-1}$, assuming\none electron per lithium atom. However, silicon has the ability to take\nup a substantially greater amount of lithium in its crystal structure,\nwith a maximum of nearly four lithium atoms per silicon atom\n(Li$_{3.75}$Si), and a specific capacity of 3,600 mAh g$^{-1}$. However,\nwith this ability to eat such large amounts of lithium, silicon gets\nbloated. The periodic volumetric expansion of the anode upon charging\nand discharging (up to 320% expansion) imposes significant mechanical\nstrains on the structure of the device. The silicon must be made into\nnanowires or nanoparticles in order to accommodate the volumetric\nexpansion without cracking, but changing the form factor of the silicon\nis not without its own challenges, as the \"breathing\" of these particles\nstill have the potential to disrupt the interior structure of the cell.\nAttempts to mitigate the volumetric expansion have included the use of\ncarbon containing binders between silicon nanoparticles to increase the\nmechanical stability, however cracking still occurs. Conductive polymers\nincorporated into gels which absorb the mechanical work energy\nassociated with lithiation of silicon have recently shown some success.\nThese polymeric and gel-like binders must obviously be conductive to\nlithium ions. This requirement imposes some additional constraints on\nwhat materials can be used. Despite these challenges, silicon anodes are\nhighly desirable, and an effective strategy is to split the difference\nbetween stability and charge capacity, and to use a mixture of graphite\nand silicon.\n\n#### Alternative cathode materials\n\nIn a lithium-ion battery, the anode and cathode have a similar function:\nto store lithium atoms (Li$^0$) or ions (Li$^{+}$), respectively. Such\nmaterials permit these lithium species to **intercalate** within their\ncrystal structures. The most well known intercalation compound for use\nas the cathode is lithium cobalt oxide. Compared to alternatives\nincluding lithium nickel oxide and nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxides,\nLiCoO$_2$ has a lower capacity for lithium ions, but is more stable at\nhigh-temperature operation. Unfortunately, it is still susceptible to\nrunaway oxidation of the electrolyte, which is highly exothermic, and\ncan lead to fires. Additionally, cobalt is known as a **conflict\nmineral**. Its extraction---much of which is performed in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo---is associated with resource conflict and\nenvironmental degradation. Moreover, some mining organizations have been\nfound to be in abuse of child labor. Alternative cathode materials are\nthus under intense investigation; the target being structures made from\nelements with greater natural abundance (e.g., manganese) and which are\nless susceptible to runaway oxidation and fires.\n\n#### Metal ions\n\nLithium has many advantages as a repository of electrons and for its\nability to intercalate into graphite, silicon, and intercalation\ncompounds used at the cathode. However, lithium is relatively rare\ncompared to other alkali metals, and ancillary metals used in lithium\nion batteries---primarily copper, cobalt, and nickel---suffer from high\ncost, scarcity, and other **negative externalities** of production.\nSodium-ion batteries operate on the same principle as their\nlithium-based counterparts, but with the advantage that sodium is\nubiquitous. Consider that the ocean---a staggeringly huge amount of\nliquid---is more than 1% sodium ions, by mass! One can immediately see\nwhy this small-continent amount of sodium would be so attractive for use\nin batteries.\n\nNevertheless, sodium is much larger than lithium, and thus it is more\ndifficult to achieve high energy densities with sodium than it is with\nlithium.[^11.3.8] The difference in size between sodium and lithium require\nthe use of different electrode materials. For example, instead of\ngraphite, the anode for sodium ion batteries often uses a different\nallotrope of carbon called **hard carbon**, i.e., charcoal. Hard carbon\nis produced by heating certain types of polymers, including **lignin**,\ncarbohydrates, and other precursors in the absence of oxygen at around\n1000 $^{\\circ}$ C. What results is a highly porous, amorphous material\nthat differentiates itself from other carbonaceous allotropes in that it\ncannot be converted to graphite.[^11.3.9] Hard carbon is capable of\nincorporating sodium ions into its structure. Transfer of sodium in and\nout of the solid is made easier by the fact that hard carbon is highly\nporous.\n\nAs in lithium-ion batteries, cathodic materials for their sodium-based\nalternatives also take the form of intercalation compounds. One of the\napparent advantages of sodium-ion technology is that the cathode\nmaterials have the potential to use metals other than cobalt or nickel.\nFor example, sodium metal oxides in which the metal is either iron or\nmanganese---highly earth-abundant compared to cobalt and nickel---have\ncapacities comparable to those of common cathodes used in lithium-ion\nbatteries.\n\n[^11.3.1]: At the time of this writing, a major breakthrough was achieved in\n    the production of energy by fusion. However, most experts agree that\n    it will take quite a long time for such methods of energy production\n    to become widespread.\n\n[^11.3.2]: A fuel cell takes in a chemical fuel, e.g., hydrogen, and outputs\n    electricity and water vapor.\n\n[^11.3.3]: This naming convention between oxidation and reduction, frankly,\n    always annoyed me. The physical particle changing hands is an\n    electron, which has mass, so why would a species be \"reduced\" in any\n    way by accepting additional mass? The reason is that humans probably\n    didn't know that the negative charge was the one that actually had\n    physical mass, i.e., the electron, and that the positive charge was\n    simply the absence of this electron. \"Reduction\" comes from the fact\n    that the charge gets reduced from positive to less positive (or more\n    negative). \"Oxidation\" comes from the fact that when atoms get\n    oxygen atoms attached to them, the highly electronegative oxygen\n    atoms draw electron density away and thus the atoms to which the\n    oxygens are attached become more positive.\n\n[^11.3.4]: If you want, you can use the mnemonic \"Annie the ox\" and \"Cathy\n    the red cat.\"\n\n[^11.3.5]: I tend to think of the \"t\" in *cathode* as a positive sign, and\n    thus I remember which is which. Keep in mind however that in a solar\n    cell, the positive charges come out at the anode. The best way to\n    reconcile this apparent contradiction is that the anode is always\n    the electrode where *conventional*---i.e., positive---current enters\n    the device *most easily*. Consider large forward biases where the\n    current gets really high at positive voltages. In a solar cell, this\n    is positive current entering the anode. If you don't want to think\n    about any of this stuff, just memorize them separately: in a\n    battery, anode is negative; in a solar cell, it is positive. Sorry!\n\n[^11.3.6]: The unusual unit of kilowatt-hours means that there is enough\n    potential energy in the battery to run 100 kW worth of electrical\n    load for 1 h. Granted, the battery may not be able to discharge that\n    fast, but that's the energy capacity assuming you could. It could\n    also power 1 kW worth of electrical load over 100 h. However you\n    want to think about it. That is equivalent to running a hair dryer\n    or toaster oven for 4 days straight.\n\n[^11.3.7]: For some reason, small batteries are rated in terms of current\n    $\\times$ time. The value of 0.01 kWh is derived from a 2 ampere-hour\n    (2000 mAh) battery discharging at a potential difference of 5 V.\n\n[^11.3.8]: Note that whether the atom is lithium or sodium otherwise makes no\n    difference: both have a single ionizable electron and can be\n    oxidized only one time.\n\n[^11.3.9]: A different range of precursors, including fossilized coal or oil,\n    is heated in the absence of oxygen to generate **soft carbon**, or\n    *coke*, which can be further converted to graphite.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Batteries\nA future society based on abundant, renewable energy sources such as\nfrom wind and solar require a place to store the energy once it is\ngenerated. The reason that storage is needed is that these sources are\nintermittent. The wind isn't always blowing and the sun is really only\nat its brightest from around 10 am to 4 pm. In contrast, fossil fuels\nsuch as coal and natural gas can be burned whenever. Their physical form\nsolves the storage issue automatically. Thus, we need to find a way to\nbuffer electricity demand during the times in which energy from wind and\nsolar is not being generated.[^11.3.1] Many potential solutions have been\nproposed, such as pumping water \"uphill\" or into dams and then releasing\nit after the sun goes down to generate \"on demand\" hydroelectric power.\nIndeed, this approach is gaining traction. Other solutions involve\nconverting excess energy generated during windy and sunny times into\nchemical fuels, such as hydrogen, which when burned in an engine or\n**fuel cell**[^11.3.2] can be used to generate electricity. However, perhaps\nthe most attractive mechanism for portable energy storage is by\nmanipulating electrochemical potentials. That is, batteries. Modern\nbattery technologies, exemplified in the now-ubiquitous lithium ion\ntype, are full of examples of nanoengineered systems. We examine the\nbasics, below.\n\n### 11.3.1. Operation of batteries\n\nA battery operates by manipulating the natural tendencies of some atoms,\nmolecules, or materials to want to give up electrons and the tendencies\nof other materials to accept these electrons. Those species which give\nup electrons are said to be **oxidized** in the process, while those\nthat accept electrons are said to be **reduced**.[^11.3.3] When electrons\nflow from one **half cell** to the other, when connected by a wire, the\nelectrochemical potential can be captured to power a load. The battery\nstops working when the two half cells are at thermodynamic equilibrium,\nand there is no longer any tendency for electrons to go from one\nmaterial to the other. We explore the operation of a battery in more\ndetail, below.\n\n#### Definitions\n\nA battery comprises two **half-cells**---an oxidation half-cell and a\nreduction half-cell. The oxidation half-cell consists of a material with\na strong tendency to give up electrons and the reduction half-cell is a\nmaterial that accepts these electrons. You may have heard the terms\n**anode** and **cathode**. The anode is the site of oxidation and the\ncathode is the site of reduction.[^11.3.4] The anode is thus the negatively\ncharged electrode and the cathode is the positively charged one.[^11.3.5] The\nquintessential battery consists of one or more **galvanic cells**. A\ngalvanic or voltaic cell consists of two elemental metals with different\noxidation potentials. These metal **electrodes** are immersed in\nseparate beakers in **electrolyte solution**. The electrodes are\nconnected to a voltmeter or **load** (like a light bulb) using a wire.\nThe beakers are connected using a **salt bridge** which can be, for\nexample, a glass tube filled with a **hydrogel** saturated with a\nsolution of an inert salt.\n\nThe classic example of a galvanic cell has a zinc anode and a copper\ncathode. The oxidation half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-}$$\n\nAnd the reduction half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-} = \\text{Cu}^0$$\n\nFor an overall reaction of\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + \\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Cu}^0 + \\text{Zn}^{2+}$$\n\nOnce this system is in place, electrons flow from the zinc (which wants\nto be oxidized) to the wire, through the load, to the copper (which\nwants to be reduced). Charge neutrality must be maintained, otherwise a\nhuge excess of positive charge would build up at the anodic half cell\nand vice versa. The system maintains charge neutrality by the drift of\nions through the salt bridge. In the example drawn in Figure (11.8), the\nions that migrate are sulfate.\n\n(Figure 11.8) \n>>>image(zinc-copper.png.0)\n\nThe voltage of the cell can be determined by summing up the oxidation\npotentials of the two half reactions. The electrochemical potential\nenergies of metals is tabulated in the form of the **reduction\npotential**, not the oxidation potential. Thus the potential energy of\nthe whole cell is given by\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$$\n\nIn this case, the standard reduction potential of zinc is -0.76 V and\nthe standard reduction potential of copper is 0.34 V. The total\npotential of the galvanic cell is thus 1.10 V. When we say *standard*\nreduction potential, we are making a reference to the **standard\nhydrogen electrode**, which involves the reaction of two protons with\ntwo electrons to form H$_2$, or hydrogen gas.\n\n#### Key figures of merit: Power and energy\n\nIn modern technology, you may sometimes hear, in jest, the mantra\n*better, faster, cheaper!*. For battery technologies, you could be a bit\nmore specific, and say *more energy density, more power density, safer,\nlighter, and more earth-abundant*. There are other key figures of merit\nas well.\n\n**Energy density** refers to the total amount of potential energy that\ncan be stored in the electrochemical cells per unit mass. It is the\ntotal capacity of the battery. For example, the lithium-ion batteries\ninside electric vehicles might have a total capacity of 100\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) or 360 megajoules (MJ).[^11.3.6] The capacity of the\nbattery in your phone is closer to 0.01 kWh.[^11.3.7]\n\n**Power density** refers to the speed at which the energy can be\nextracted from the battery. Power, in terms of watts, or joules per\nsecond, is dependent on the molecular level processes occurring in the\nelectrochemical cells. That is, oxidation and reduction at the\nelectrodes, along with transport and diffusion of electrons and ions\nbetween the two half-cells.\n\nThe energy and power densities are often expressed in terms of\n**specific energy** and **specific power** in units of J kg$^{-1}$ or W\nkg$^{-1}$. Note that these densities are per mass (gravimetric) not per\nvolume (volumetric). The specific energies and the specific powers for\nenergy storage devices are often regarded to be in competition. For\nexample, a capacitor can deliver power very quickly (think of a camera\nflash), but cannot store very much energy because it can only hold a\nthin layer of charge at the surface of metallic films. Alternatively, a\nfuel cell which converts hydrogen to electricity discharges very slowly\nbut has a ton of potential energy stored in its chemical bonds (i.e., of\nH$_2$). A convenient way to visualize the energy density and power\ndensity is the Ragone (rah-GO-nee) plot, see Figure (11.9).\n\n(Figure 11.9) \n>>>image(ragone.png.0)\n\nDespite the strong correlation between specific energy and specific\npower, there is still room for optimization. Much of this latitude is\nafforded by, you guessed it, nanoengineering of the electrode materials.\nWe look at the special case of lithium ion batteries, below.\n\n### 11.3.2. Lithium-ion batteries: materials selection\n\nLithium ion batteries operate by the movement of lithium ions (Li$^+$)\nand electrons (e$^-$) between two half cells. One half cell, the anode,\ncontains graphite and lithium atoms (Li$^0$). The other half cell, the\ncathode, contains lithium metal (often cobalt) oxide (see Figure\n(11.10)). The two half cells are separated by a membrane electrolyte\nwhich is permeable to lithium ions. In normal operation, when the cells\nare fully charged, the lithium metal atoms on the anode side give up\ntheir electrons. The graphite is connected to a copper film, which\nitself is connected to a wire. The electron exits the anode into the\ncopper film and thence to a wire, where the current flow can be used to\npower an electrical load. Meanwhile, the lithium ions traverse the\nelectrolyte **separator** to the cathode half-cell. The cathode\nhalf-cell consists of an **intercalation compound**, of which the\narchetype is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO$_2$). The cathode is supported\nby a film of metal, typically aluminum. The electrons---after passing\nthrough the wire connecting the two half cells---enter the cathode and\nreduce the lithium ions back to lithium metal. When the battery is\n(re)charged, a positive bias is applied to the cathode. Electrons leave\nthe lithium metal and the lithium ions that are created migrate back\nover to the anode and take up residence between the graphene sheets of\nthe graphite anode.\n\n(Figure 11.10) \n>>>image(lithium ion.png.0)\n\n#### Anodes\n\nThe graphene sheets that make up the graphite are the perfect home for\nthe small lithium atoms. Recall that in a classical galvanic cell, the\nmetal ions either detach upon oxidation or deposit by reduction onto the\nelectrodes themselves. The metal electrodes either shrink or increase in\nmass, depending on the direction of the flow of current. It is actually\nthe negatively charged counterion in the electrolyte solution that\nmigrates via the salt bridge to balance the excess of charge. In a\nlithium-ion battery, the solid electrodes consist of graphite and\nlithium cobalt oxide. Both materials are able to accommodate lithium\nspecies within their solid structures. Thus, these materials can be\ndischarged and charged again while the changes to their structures are\nnominally reversible.\n\nDespite its popularity as an anode material, graphite has a somewhat low\nspecific capacity, owing to its low volumetric change upon lithiation.\nIn contrast, silicon can undergo a very large increase in volume\n(5$\\times$) and thus accommodate many more lithium atoms. Challenges to\nthe use of silicon anodes are indeed related to this large and\nreversible volumetric change. This cycling in size can lead to cracking,\nand thus polymeric binders that are permeable to ions must be\nengineered. Nevertheless, silicon anodes are used in the commercial\nmarket, with increased specific charge associated with, for example,\ngreater range in electric vehicles.\n\n#### Cathodes\n\nThe conventional cathode of lithium cobalt oxide is known as an\n**intercalation compound**, which means that some species---in this case\nlithium atoms---can slide into the crystal structure. These materials\nare selected for various applications on the basis of either total\ncapacity of charge storage or the speed with which the charges can be\nextracted. For example, while cathodes based on lithium cobalt oxide\nmight be the best for relatively low-power devices like smartphones and\nlaptops, they may not be the best for electric vehicles, which require a\nlot of power quickly. Researchers are constantly looking for new types\nof intercalation compounds that can shuttle ions in and out of their\ncrystal structures quickly.\n\n### 11.3.3. Case study: electric vehicles\n\nIndeed the ability to move lithium ions and atoms in and out of the\nelectrodes is hugely important for the electrification of the economy.\nMuch of the energy usage associated with carbon emissions and thus\nglobal climate change comes through the transportation sector of the\neconomy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take a majority of the\nmarket share of new vehicles sold in the United States by around\n2030-2035. The expectation of huge growth is supported by (1)\nenvironmental regulation, (2) consumer tax incentives, and (3) the fact\nthat many aspects of ownership of EVs are superior to those of vehicles\npowered by an **internal combustion engine (ICE)**. The electrification\nof the transportation sector of the economy is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of strategies for the electrochemical storage of\nenergy---i.e., batteries. As you know, batteries have been used in\nautomobiles for many decades. Headlights, radios, and power windows have\nalways required electricity. Nevertheless, the movement of vehicles\nweighing thousands of pounds over ranges of hundreds of miles has\nrequired the development of new types of battery technologies.\n\n#### Oldie but goodie: The lead-acid battery\n\nVehicles have had electrical components for around a century.\nHeadlights, indoor lighting, audio equipment, and operation of the\ninstrument clusters use a **lead-acid** battery (starting, lighting, and\nignition, the \"SLI\" tasks). The lead acid battery was invented in the\nmid-nineteenth century, and was the first **rechargeable** battery to be\ndiscovered. It may be surprising to learn that essentially all low\n(12-volt) applications in automobiles are still powered by the lead-acid\nbattery, and to this day this ancient technology represents around 50%\nof the market share of batteries sold in the world.\n\nA lead-acid battery consists of an elemental (i.e., metallic) lead\nelectrode separated by an electrolyte, sometimes a gel, containing\nsulfuric acid. The cathode consists of lead oxide (PbO$_2$). In\noperation, excess electrons travel from the metallic lead through an\nexternal wire to power the peripheral devices of the car. The lead oxide\nis reduced by the electrons returning to the cathode. During this\nreduction reaction, an oxygen ion (O$^{2-}$) is ejected. It quickly\npicks up two acidic hydrogen ions (protons) from the sulfuric acid, and\nbecomes water. The naked sulfate ion that is produced migrates through\nthe liquid or gel electrolyte to the anode, where the lead atoms that\nlost their two electrons combine with the sulfate to become lead\nsulfate. (Actually, both the anode and the cathode when fully discharged\nbecome lead sulfate.) The equilibration of the electrochemical\npotentials leads to a **dead battery**. The **alternator** of the car\nturns excess mechanical energy into electrical potential that is used to\nrecharge the battery.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the architecture of the lead acid battery as\na textbook galvanic cell with wires connected to thick slabs of lead and\nlead oxide separated by an electrolyte. In reality, however, a car\nbattery has a hierarchical structure. The anodes and cathodes are made\ninto thin plates covered by a nanoporous separator membrane that allows\nions through prevents contact and thus short circuiting of the\nelectrodes. Groups of plates are slid into place in an interdigitated\nstructure like two combs or the opposing sides of a zipper. In this\nstructure, the anode and cathode materials alternate. The purpose of\nthis structure is to increase the total surface area to permit facile\ncharging and discharging. The space between the interdigitated\nelectrodes is filled with an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Other\nstructures---e.g., concentric cylinders---are used for other\napplications.\n\nEach cell in a lead-acid battery has a nominal voltage of 2.1 V. To\nachieve a total voltage of 12 V, six of these cells are connected in\nseries, with the negative terminal (anode) of one cell connected to the\npositive terminal (cathode) of the next. The lead-acid battery is\ncapable of around 500 full discharge cycles before it must be replaced.\nThe finite lifetime of a lead-acid battery is the result of the\nformation of a crystallized form of lead sulfate that forms at both the\nanode and the cathode which, unlike amorphous lead sulfate, does not\nrevert back to the pure lead and lead oxide phases when recharged. Once\nthis unwanted process of **sulfation** is completed, the battery is\ndead.\n\n#### The lithium-ion \"traction\" battery\n\nAll hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric vehicles also have a\nlarger, more powerful battery on board. This is the so-called **traction\nbattery**, because it is used not to power the ignition and the\nrelatively low-power lights and peripherals in the passenger cabin, but\nthe wheels. The fact that electric vehicles even had two batteries for\ndifferent purposes was made strikingly clear to me on a recent camping\ntrip in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park near San Diego. In order to unload\nour food, drinks, tent, and other accessories, we left the lift gate of\nour plugin hybrid vehichle open, and didn't close it for several hours.\nUnbeknownst to me, the opening of the lift gate engaged all kinds of\nelectronic circuits in the inside of the car. I had believed that the 10\nkWh battery---half full at the time we parked---would make the phrase\n\"dead battery\" a thing of the past, at least for drivers of cars with\nbig lithium ion batteries. It turns out that this battery has a highly\nspecialized purpose, and that it is to power the wheels, and little\nelse. Apparently, the lead-acid battery needs to have charge even to\nturn the car on! By leaving the lift gate open, I had depleted the\nlead-acid battery and the car would not even start. Thankfully, we had a\n12-volt battery pack with us that we had purchased to jump a different\ncar left unused in our garage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had\nbrought this battery to charge our USB devices, and were able to use it\nto start the car.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, along with functionally equivalent\nlithium-polymer batteries (which use a polymeric electrolyte), have\nhigher energy densities than lead-acid batteries and also longer\nlifetimes. They can in general be discharged deeper with less\ndegradation in capacity. Traction batteries with capacities of 200 V can\nbe produced by combining many **cells** with nominal voltages of 3 to 4\nV in various arrangements into the **battery pack**. Lithium-ion\nbatteries are considered a technology of moderate maturity, which means\nthat there are many avenues for potential discovery and improvement.\n\n### 11.3.4. Areas for discovery\n\nBattery technologies---and in particular those based on the lithium-ion\nconcept---are still in a rich phase of research and development. Many\nuniversity and industrial laboratories are working to increase the power\ndensity, energy density, lifetime, safety, recyclability, and\nenvironmental burden of the components. Here, we highlight a few areas\nwhich represent potentially fruitful avenues which are receiving\nsignificant attention and research funding.\n\n#### The solid electrolyte interface\n\nOne of the chief reasons that a lithium-ion battery loses its capacity\nover its lifetime is because of unwanted reactions at the surface of the\nanode. These reactions occur because of the high reduction potential of\nthe anode and thus its ability to react with molecules within the\nelectrolyte. Eventually, this process leads to the formation of a crusty\nsubstance at the surface of the anode. This crust contains many types of\ncompounds and a composition and morphology that depends on the identity\nof the molecules in the electrolyte. This crust is called the **solid\nelectrolyte interface (SEI)**. The formation of the SEI is regarded as\ninevitable, but it is nevertheless the object of intense study.\nCharacterization of the compounds that form at the SEI and examination\nof the way in which the compounds within the battery influence its\nmorphology could lead to better selection of materials or architecture\nof the device. In particular, designs that slow the growth of the SEI or\nallow its growth to proceed in a more predictable manner are desirable.\n\nThere are several ways in which the SEI has undesirable consequences on\nthe performance of a lithium-ion battery over time. For example, as the\nanode reduces the molecules of the electrolyte---often carbonate\nsolvents---electron-rich products are formed. To balance the charge,\npositively charged lithium ions become incorporated in these products.\nThe formation of these lithium-containing compounds is irreversible and\nleads to a reduction in **lithium inventory** in the cell. Since lithium\natoms and ions are the currency of the battery, sequestration of lithium\nin the SEI is equivalent to taking money out of the economy by putting\nit under your mattress and then forgetting about it. Another way in\nwhich the SEI reduces the effectiveness of the battery is by blocking\nthe migration of lithium into and out of the anode. This characteristic\nof the SEI may reduce the power density. A final way in which the SEI\nacts to reduce the efficiency of the battery may be counterintuitive.\nThat is, the SEI may be electrically conductive. Greater conductivity of\nelectrons means a greater rate of unwanted electrochemical reduction of\nthe compounds making up the electrolyte. This increase leads to greater\ngrowth rate of the SEI, and thus a greater degradation of the\nelectrolyte, loss of lithium inventory, decreased rate of lithium\nexchange with the anode, and so on. Thus, understanding the composition\nof the SEI, its material properties, and methods to limit its formation\nare key to increased usage of lithium-ion batteries in transportation\nand grid-scale energy storage.\n\n#### Alternative anode materials\n\nGraphite has been the go-to anode material for its ability to house\nlithium atoms in between its layers of graphene sheets. However, the\ntheoretical capacity of graphite to store lithium is limited to a single\nlithium atom per six carbon atoms (LiC$_6$). This stoichiometry\ncorresponds to a specific charge capacity of 372 mAh g$^{-1}$, assuming\none electron per lithium atom. However, silicon has the ability to take\nup a substantially greater amount of lithium in its crystal structure,\nwith a maximum of nearly four lithium atoms per silicon atom\n(Li$_{3.75}$Si), and a specific capacity of 3,600 mAh g$^{-1}$. However,\nwith this ability to eat such large amounts of lithium, silicon gets\nbloated. The periodic volumetric expansion of the anode upon charging\nand discharging (up to 320% expansion) imposes significant mechanical\nstrains on the structure of the device. The silicon must be made into\nnanowires or nanoparticles in order to accommodate the volumetric\nexpansion without cracking, but changing the form factor of the silicon\nis not without its own challenges, as the \"breathing\" of these particles\nstill have the potential to disrupt the interior structure of the cell.\nAttempts to mitigate the volumetric expansion have included the use of\ncarbon containing binders between silicon nanoparticles to increase the\nmechanical stability, however cracking still occurs. Conductive polymers\nincorporated into gels which absorb the mechanical work energy\nassociated with lithiation of silicon have recently shown some success.\nThese polymeric and gel-like binders must obviously be conductive to\nlithium ions. This requirement imposes some additional constraints on\nwhat materials can be used. Despite these challenges, silicon anodes are\nhighly desirable, and an effective strategy is to split the difference\nbetween stability and charge capacity, and to use a mixture of graphite\nand silicon.\n\n#### Alternative cathode materials\n\nIn a lithium-ion battery, the anode and cathode have a similar function:\nto store lithium atoms (Li$^0$) or ions (Li$^{+}$), respectively. Such\nmaterials permit these lithium species to **intercalate** within their\ncrystal structures. The most well known intercalation compound for use\nas the cathode is lithium cobalt oxide. Compared to alternatives\nincluding lithium nickel oxide and nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxides,\nLiCoO$_2$ has a lower capacity for lithium ions, but is more stable at\nhigh-temperature operation. Unfortunately, it is still susceptible to\nrunaway oxidation of the electrolyte, which is highly exothermic, and\ncan lead to fires. Additionally, cobalt is known as a **conflict\nmineral**. Its extraction---much of which is performed in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo---is associated with resource conflict and\nenvironmental degradation. Moreover, some mining organizations have been\nfound to be in abuse of child labor. Alternative cathode materials are\nthus under intense investigation; the target being structures made from\nelements with greater natural abundance (e.g., manganese) and which are\nless susceptible to runaway oxidation and fires.\n\n#### Metal ions\n\nLithium has many advantages as a repository of electrons and for its\nability to intercalate into graphite, silicon, and intercalation\ncompounds used at the cathode. However, lithium is relatively rare\ncompared to other alkali metals, and ancillary metals used in lithium\nion batteries---primarily copper, cobalt, and nickel---suffer from high\ncost, scarcity, and other **negative externalities** of production.\nSodium-ion batteries operate on the same principle as their\nlithium-based counterparts, but with the advantage that sodium is\nubiquitous. Consider that the ocean---a staggeringly huge amount of\nliquid---is more than 1% sodium ions, by mass! One can immediately see\nwhy this small-continent amount of sodium would be so attractive for use\nin batteries.\n\nNevertheless, sodium is much larger than lithium, and thus it is more\ndifficult to achieve high energy densities with sodium than it is with\nlithium.[^11.3.8] The difference in size between sodium and lithium require\nthe use of different electrode materials. For example, instead of\ngraphite, the anode for sodium ion batteries often uses a different\nallotrope of carbon called **hard carbon**, i.e., charcoal. Hard carbon\nis produced by heating certain types of polymers, including **lignin**,\ncarbohydrates, and other precursors in the absence of oxygen at around\n1000 $^{\\circ}$ C. What results is a highly porous, amorphous material\nthat differentiates itself from other carbonaceous allotropes in that it\ncannot be converted to graphite.[^11.3.9] Hard carbon is capable of\nincorporating sodium ions into its structure. Transfer of sodium in and\nout of the solid is made easier by the fact that hard carbon is highly\nporous.\n\nAs in lithium-ion batteries, cathodic materials for their sodium-based\nalternatives also take the form of intercalation compounds. One of the\napparent advantages of sodium-ion technology is that the cathode\nmaterials have the potential to use metals other than cobalt or nickel.\nFor example, sodium metal oxides in which the metal is either iron or\nmanganese---highly earth-abundant compared to cobalt and nickel---have\ncapacities comparable to those of common cathodes used in lithium-ion\nbatteries.\n\n[^11.3.1]: At the time of this writing, a major breakthrough was achieved in\n    the production of energy by fusion. However, most experts agree that\n    it will take quite a long time for such methods of energy production\n    to become widespread.\n\n[^11.3.2]: A fuel cell takes in a chemical fuel, e.g., hydrogen, and outputs\n    electricity and water vapor.\n\n[^11.3.3]: This naming convention between oxidation and reduction, frankly,\n    always annoyed me. The physical particle changing hands is an\n    electron, which has mass, so why would a species be \"reduced\" in any\n    way by accepting additional mass? The reason is that humans probably\n    didn't know that the negative charge was the one that actually had\n    physical mass, i.e., the electron, and that the positive charge was\n    simply the absence of this electron. \"Reduction\" comes from the fact\n    that the charge gets reduced from positive to less positive (or more\n    negative). \"Oxidation\" comes from the fact that when atoms get\n    oxygen atoms attached to them, the highly electronegative oxygen\n    atoms draw electron density away and thus the atoms to which the\n    oxygens are attached become more positive.\n\n[^11.3.4]: If you want, you can use the mnemonic \"Annie the ox\" and \"Cathy\n    the red cat.\"\n\n[^11.3.5]: I tend to think of the \"t\" in *cathode* as a positive sign, and\n    thus I remember which is which. Keep in mind however that in a solar\n    cell, the positive charges come out at the anode. The best way to\n    reconcile this apparent contradiction is that the anode is always\n    the electrode where *conventional*---i.e., positive---current enters\n    the device *most easily*. Consider large forward biases where the\n    current gets really high at positive voltages. In a solar cell, this\n    is positive current entering the anode. If you don't want to think\n    about any of this stuff, just memorize them separately: in a\n    battery, anode is negative; in a solar cell, it is positive. Sorry!\n\n[^11.3.6]: The unusual unit of kilowatt-hours means that there is enough\n    potential energy in the battery to run 100 kW worth of electrical\n    load for 1 h. Granted, the battery may not be able to discharge that\n    fast, but that's the energy capacity assuming you could. It could\n    also power 1 kW worth of electrical load over 100 h. However you\n    want to think about it. That is equivalent to running a hair dryer\n    or toaster oven for 4 days straight.\n\n[^11.3.7]: For some reason, small batteries are rated in terms of current\n    $\\times$ time. The value of 0.01 kWh is derived from a 2 ampere-hour\n    (2000 mAh) battery discharging at a potential difference of 5 V.\n\n[^11.3.8]: Note that whether the atom is lithium or sodium otherwise makes no\n    difference: both have a single ionizable electron and can be\n    oxidized only one time.\n\n[^11.3.9]: A different range of precursors, including fossilized coal or oil,\n    is heated in the absence of oxygen to generate **soft carbon**, or\n    *coke*, which can be further converted to graphite.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

Many of the nanoscale materials and phenomena we have\nexplored in this book are directly relevant to devices and processes\nused for the production and use of energy. This chapter provides two\ncase studies for the use of nanoscale materials which already have huge\nworldwide markets: catalysis and electrochemical energy storage in the\nform of batteries.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Batteries\nA future society based on abundant, renewable energy sources such as\nfrom wind and solar require a place to store the energy once it is\ngenerated. The reason that storage is needed is that these sources are\nintermittent. The wind isn't always blowing and the sun is really only\nat its brightest from around 10 am to 4 pm. In contrast, fossil fuels\nsuch as coal and natural gas can be burned whenever. Their physical form\nsolves the storage issue automatically. Thus, we need to find a way to\nbuffer electricity demand during the times in which energy from wind and\nsolar is not being generated.[^11.3.1] Many potential solutions have been\nproposed, such as pumping water \"uphill\" or into dams and then releasing\nit after the sun goes down to generate \"on demand\" hydroelectric power.\nIndeed, this approach is gaining traction. Other solutions involve\nconverting excess energy generated during windy and sunny times into\nchemical fuels, such as hydrogen, which when burned in an engine or\n**fuel cell**[^11.3.2] can be used to generate electricity. However, perhaps\nthe most attractive mechanism for portable energy storage is by\nmanipulating electrochemical potentials. That is, batteries. Modern\nbattery technologies, exemplified in the now-ubiquitous lithium ion\ntype, are full of examples of nanoengineered systems. We examine the\nbasics, below.\n\n### 11.3.1. Operation of batteries\n\nA battery operates by manipulating the natural tendencies of some atoms,\nmolecules, or materials to want to give up electrons and the tendencies\nof other materials to accept these electrons. Those species which give\nup electrons are said to be **oxidized** in the process, while those\nthat accept electrons are said to be **reduced**.[^11.3.3] When electrons\nflow from one **half cell** to the other, when connected by a wire, the\nelectrochemical potential can be captured to power a load. The battery\nstops working when the two half cells are at thermodynamic equilibrium,\nand there is no longer any tendency for electrons to go from one\nmaterial to the other. We explore the operation of a battery in more\ndetail, below.\n\n#### Definitions\n\nA battery comprises two **half-cells**---an oxidation half-cell and a\nreduction half-cell. The oxidation half-cell consists of a material with\na strong tendency to give up electrons and the reduction half-cell is a\nmaterial that accepts these electrons. You may have heard the terms\n**anode** and **cathode**. The anode is the site of oxidation and the\ncathode is the site of reduction.[^11.3.4] The anode is thus the negatively\ncharged electrode and the cathode is the positively charged one.[^11.3.5] The\nquintessential battery consists of one or more **galvanic cells**. A\ngalvanic or voltaic cell consists of two elemental metals with different\noxidation potentials. These metal **electrodes** are immersed in\nseparate beakers in **electrolyte solution**. The electrodes are\nconnected to a voltmeter or **load** (like a light bulb) using a wire.\nThe beakers are connected using a **salt bridge** which can be, for\nexample, a glass tube filled with a **hydrogel** saturated with a\nsolution of an inert salt.\n\nThe classic example of a galvanic cell has a zinc anode and a copper\ncathode. The oxidation half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-}$$\n\nAnd the reduction half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-} = \\text{Cu}^0$$\n\nFor an overall reaction of\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + \\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Cu}^0 + \\text{Zn}^{2+}$$\n\nOnce this system is in place, electrons flow from the zinc (which wants\nto be oxidized) to the wire, through the load, to the copper (which\nwants to be reduced). Charge neutrality must be maintained, otherwise a\nhuge excess of positive charge would build up at the anodic half cell\nand vice versa. The system maintains charge neutrality by the drift of\nions through the salt bridge. In the example drawn in Figure (11.8), the\nions that migrate are sulfate.\n\n(Figure 11.8) \n>>>image(zinc-copper.png.0)\n\nThe voltage of the cell can be determined by summing up the oxidation\npotentials of the two half reactions. The electrochemical potential\nenergies of metals is tabulated in the form of the **reduction\npotential**, not the oxidation potential. Thus the potential energy of\nthe whole cell is given by\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$$\n\nIn this case, the standard reduction potential of zinc is -0.76 V and\nthe standard reduction potential of copper is 0.34 V. The total\npotential of the galvanic cell is thus 1.10 V. When we say *standard*\nreduction potential, we are making a reference to the **standard\nhydrogen electrode**, which involves the reaction of two protons with\ntwo electrons to form H$_2$, or hydrogen gas.\n\n#### Key figures of merit: Power and energy\n\nIn modern technology, you may sometimes hear, in jest, the mantra\n*better, faster, cheaper!*. For battery technologies, you could be a bit\nmore specific, and say *more energy density, more power density, safer,\nlighter, and more earth-abundant*. There are other key figures of merit\nas well.\n\n**Energy density** refers to the total amount of potential energy that\ncan be stored in the electrochemical cells per unit mass. It is the\ntotal capacity of the battery. For example, the lithium-ion batteries\ninside electric vehicles might have a total capacity of 100\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) or 360 megajoules (MJ).[^11.3.6] The capacity of the\nbattery in your phone is closer to 0.01 kWh.[^11.3.7]\n\n**Power density** refers to the speed at which the energy can be\nextracted from the battery. Power, in terms of watts, or joules per\nsecond, is dependent on the molecular level processes occurring in the\nelectrochemical cells. That is, oxidation and reduction at the\nelectrodes, along with transport and diffusion of electrons and ions\nbetween the two half-cells.\n\nThe energy and power densities are often expressed in terms of\n**specific energy** and **specific power** in units of J kg$^{-1}$ or W\nkg$^{-1}$. Note that these densities are per mass (gravimetric) not per\nvolume (volumetric). The specific energies and the specific powers for\nenergy storage devices are often regarded to be in competition. For\nexample, a capacitor can deliver power very quickly (think of a camera\nflash), but cannot store very much energy because it can only hold a\nthin layer of charge at the surface of metallic films. Alternatively, a\nfuel cell which converts hydrogen to electricity discharges very slowly\nbut has a ton of potential energy stored in its chemical bonds (i.e., of\nH$_2$). A convenient way to visualize the energy density and power\ndensity is the Ragone (rah-GO-nee) plot, see Figure (11.9).\n\n(Figure 11.9) \n>>>image(ragone.png.0)\n\nDespite the strong correlation between specific energy and specific\npower, there is still room for optimization. Much of this latitude is\nafforded by, you guessed it, nanoengineering of the electrode materials.\nWe look at the special case of lithium ion batteries, below.\n\n### 11.3.2. Lithium-ion batteries: materials selection\n\nLithium ion batteries operate by the movement of lithium ions (Li$^+$)\nand electrons (e$^-$) between two half cells. One half cell, the anode,\ncontains graphite and lithium atoms (Li$^0$). The other half cell, the\ncathode, contains lithium metal (often cobalt) oxide (see Figure\n(11.10)). The two half cells are separated by a membrane electrolyte\nwhich is permeable to lithium ions. In normal operation, when the cells\nare fully charged, the lithium metal atoms on the anode side give up\ntheir electrons. The graphite is connected to a copper film, which\nitself is connected to a wire. The electron exits the anode into the\ncopper film and thence to a wire, where the current flow can be used to\npower an electrical load. Meanwhile, the lithium ions traverse the\nelectrolyte **separator** to the cathode half-cell. The cathode\nhalf-cell consists of an **intercalation compound**, of which the\narchetype is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO$_2$). The cathode is supported\nby a film of metal, typically aluminum. The electrons---after passing\nthrough the wire connecting the two half cells---enter the cathode and\nreduce the lithium ions back to lithium metal. When the battery is\n(re)charged, a positive bias is applied to the cathode. Electrons leave\nthe lithium metal and the lithium ions that are created migrate back\nover to the anode and take up residence between the graphene sheets of\nthe graphite anode.\n\n(Figure 11.10) \n>>>image(lithium ion.png.0)\n\n#### Anodes\n\nThe graphene sheets that make up the graphite are the perfect home for\nthe small lithium atoms. Recall that in a classical galvanic cell, the\nmetal ions either detach upon oxidation or deposit by reduction onto the\nelectrodes themselves. The metal electrodes either shrink or increase in\nmass, depending on the direction of the flow of current. It is actually\nthe negatively charged counterion in the electrolyte solution that\nmigrates via the salt bridge to balance the excess of charge. In a\nlithium-ion battery, the solid electrodes consist of graphite and\nlithium cobalt oxide. Both materials are able to accommodate lithium\nspecies within their solid structures. Thus, these materials can be\ndischarged and charged again while the changes to their structures are\nnominally reversible.\n\nDespite its popularity as an anode material, graphite has a somewhat low\nspecific capacity, owing to its low volumetric change upon lithiation.\nIn contrast, silicon can undergo a very large increase in volume\n(5$\\times$) and thus accommodate many more lithium atoms. Challenges to\nthe use of silicon anodes are indeed related to this large and\nreversible volumetric change. This cycling in size can lead to cracking,\nand thus polymeric binders that are permeable to ions must be\nengineered. Nevertheless, silicon anodes are used in the commercial\nmarket, with increased specific charge associated with, for example,\ngreater range in electric vehicles.\n\n#### Cathodes\n\nThe conventional cathode of lithium cobalt oxide is known as an\n**intercalation compound**, which means that some species---in this case\nlithium atoms---can slide into the crystal structure. These materials\nare selected for various applications on the basis of either total\ncapacity of charge storage or the speed with which the charges can be\nextracted. For example, while cathodes based on lithium cobalt oxide\nmight be the best for relatively low-power devices like smartphones and\nlaptops, they may not be the best for electric vehicles, which require a\nlot of power quickly. Researchers are constantly looking for new types\nof intercalation compounds that can shuttle ions in and out of their\ncrystal structures quickly.\n\n### 11.3.3. Case study: electric vehicles\n\nIndeed the ability to move lithium ions and atoms in and out of the\nelectrodes is hugely important for the electrification of the economy.\nMuch of the energy usage associated with carbon emissions and thus\nglobal climate change comes through the transportation sector of the\neconomy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take a majority of the\nmarket share of new vehicles sold in the United States by around\n2030-2035. The expectation of huge growth is supported by (1)\nenvironmental regulation, (2) consumer tax incentives, and (3) the fact\nthat many aspects of ownership of EVs are superior to those of vehicles\npowered by an **internal combustion engine (ICE)**. The electrification\nof the transportation sector of the economy is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of strategies for the electrochemical storage of\nenergy---i.e., batteries. As you know, batteries have been used in\nautomobiles for many decades. Headlights, radios, and power windows have\nalways required electricity. Nevertheless, the movement of vehicles\nweighing thousands of pounds over ranges of hundreds of miles has\nrequired the development of new types of battery technologies.\n\n#### Oldie but goodie: The lead-acid battery\n\nVehicles have had electrical components for around a century.\nHeadlights, indoor lighting, audio equipment, and operation of the\ninstrument clusters use a **lead-acid** battery (starting, lighting, and\nignition, the \"SLI\" tasks). The lead acid battery was invented in the\nmid-nineteenth century, and was the first **rechargeable** battery to be\ndiscovered. It may be surprising to learn that essentially all low\n(12-volt) applications in automobiles are still powered by the lead-acid\nbattery, and to this day this ancient technology represents around 50%\nof the market share of batteries sold in the world.\n\nA lead-acid battery consists of an elemental (i.e., metallic) lead\nelectrode separated by an electrolyte, sometimes a gel, containing\nsulfuric acid. The cathode consists of lead oxide (PbO$_2$). In\noperation, excess electrons travel from the metallic lead through an\nexternal wire to power the peripheral devices of the car. The lead oxide\nis reduced by the electrons returning to the cathode. During this\nreduction reaction, an oxygen ion (O$^{2-}$) is ejected. It quickly\npicks up two acidic hydrogen ions (protons) from the sulfuric acid, and\nbecomes water. The naked sulfate ion that is produced migrates through\nthe liquid or gel electrolyte to the anode, where the lead atoms that\nlost their two electrons combine with the sulfate to become lead\nsulfate. (Actually, both the anode and the cathode when fully discharged\nbecome lead sulfate.) The equilibration of the electrochemical\npotentials leads to a **dead battery**. The **alternator** of the car\nturns excess mechanical energy into electrical potential that is used to\nrecharge the battery.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the architecture of the lead acid battery as\na textbook galvanic cell with wires connected to thick slabs of lead and\nlead oxide separated by an electrolyte. In reality, however, a car\nbattery has a hierarchical structure. The anodes and cathodes are made\ninto thin plates covered by a nanoporous separator membrane that allows\nions through prevents contact and thus short circuiting of the\nelectrodes. Groups of plates are slid into place in an interdigitated\nstructure like two combs or the opposing sides of a zipper. In this\nstructure, the anode and cathode materials alternate. The purpose of\nthis structure is to increase the total surface area to permit facile\ncharging and discharging. The space between the interdigitated\nelectrodes is filled with an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Other\nstructures---e.g., concentric cylinders---are used for other\napplications.\n\nEach cell in a lead-acid battery has a nominal voltage of 2.1 V. To\nachieve a total voltage of 12 V, six of these cells are connected in\nseries, with the negative terminal (anode) of one cell connected to the\npositive terminal (cathode) of the next. The lead-acid battery is\ncapable of around 500 full discharge cycles before it must be replaced.\nThe finite lifetime of a lead-acid battery is the result of the\nformation of a crystallized form of lead sulfate that forms at both the\nanode and the cathode which, unlike amorphous lead sulfate, does not\nrevert back to the pure lead and lead oxide phases when recharged. Once\nthis unwanted process of **sulfation** is completed, the battery is\ndead.\n\n#### The lithium-ion \"traction\" battery\n\nAll hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric vehicles also have a\nlarger, more powerful battery on board. This is the so-called **traction\nbattery**, because it is used not to power the ignition and the\nrelatively low-power lights and peripherals in the passenger cabin, but\nthe wheels. The fact that electric vehicles even had two batteries for\ndifferent purposes was made strikingly clear to me on a recent camping\ntrip in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park near San Diego. In order to unload\nour food, drinks, tent, and other accessories, we left the lift gate of\nour plugin hybrid vehichle open, and didn't close it for several hours.\nUnbeknownst to me, the opening of the lift gate engaged all kinds of\nelectronic circuits in the inside of the car. I had believed that the 10\nkWh battery---half full at the time we parked---would make the phrase\n\"dead battery\" a thing of the past, at least for drivers of cars with\nbig lithium ion batteries. It turns out that this battery has a highly\nspecialized purpose, and that it is to power the wheels, and little\nelse. Apparently, the lead-acid battery needs to have charge even to\nturn the car on! By leaving the lift gate open, I had depleted the\nlead-acid battery and the car would not even start. Thankfully, we had a\n12-volt battery pack with us that we had purchased to jump a different\ncar left unused in our garage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had\nbrought this battery to charge our USB devices, and were able to use it\nto start the car.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, along with functionally equivalent\nlithium-polymer batteries (which use a polymeric electrolyte), have\nhigher energy densities than lead-acid batteries and also longer\nlifetimes. They can in general be discharged deeper with less\ndegradation in capacity. Traction batteries with capacities of 200 V can\nbe produced by combining many **cells** with nominal voltages of 3 to 4\nV in various arrangements into the **battery pack**. Lithium-ion\nbatteries are considered a technology of moderate maturity, which means\nthat there are many avenues for potential discovery and improvement.\n\n### 11.3.4. Areas for discovery\n\nBattery technologies---and in particular those based on the lithium-ion\nconcept---are still in a rich phase of research and development. Many\nuniversity and industrial laboratories are working to increase the power\ndensity, energy density, lifetime, safety, recyclability, and\nenvironmental burden of the components. Here, we highlight a few areas\nwhich represent potentially fruitful avenues which are receiving\nsignificant attention and research funding.\n\n#### The solid electrolyte interface\n\nOne of the chief reasons that a lithium-ion battery loses its capacity\nover its lifetime is because of unwanted reactions at the surface of the\nanode. These reactions occur because of the high reduction potential of\nthe anode and thus its ability to react with molecules within the\nelectrolyte. Eventually, this process leads to the formation of a crusty\nsubstance at the surface of the anode. This crust contains many types of\ncompounds and a composition and morphology that depends on the identity\nof the molecules in the electrolyte. This crust is called the **solid\nelectrolyte interface (SEI)**. The formation of the SEI is regarded as\ninevitable, but it is nevertheless the object of intense study.\nCharacterization of the compounds that form at the SEI and examination\nof the way in which the compounds within the battery influence its\nmorphology could lead to better selection of materials or architecture\nof the device. In particular, designs that slow the growth of the SEI or\nallow its growth to proceed in a more predictable manner are desirable.\n\nThere are several ways in which the SEI has undesirable consequences on\nthe performance of a lithium-ion battery over time. For example, as the\nanode reduces the molecules of the electrolyte---often carbonate\nsolvents---electron-rich products are formed. To balance the charge,\npositively charged lithium ions become incorporated in these products.\nThe formation of these lithium-containing compounds is irreversible and\nleads to a reduction in **lithium inventory** in the cell. Since lithium\natoms and ions are the currency of the battery, sequestration of lithium\nin the SEI is equivalent to taking money out of the economy by putting\nit under your mattress and then forgetting about it. Another way in\nwhich the SEI reduces the effectiveness of the battery is by blocking\nthe migration of lithium into and out of the anode. This characteristic\nof the SEI may reduce the power density. A final way in which the SEI\nacts to reduce the efficiency of the battery may be counterintuitive.\nThat is, the SEI may be electrically conductive. Greater conductivity of\nelectrons means a greater rate of unwanted electrochemical reduction of\nthe compounds making up the electrolyte. This increase leads to greater\ngrowth rate of the SEI, and thus a greater degradation of the\nelectrolyte, loss of lithium inventory, decreased rate of lithium\nexchange with the anode, and so on. Thus, understanding the composition\nof the SEI, its material properties, and methods to limit its formation\nare key to increased usage of lithium-ion batteries in transportation\nand grid-scale energy storage.\n\n#### Alternative anode materials\n\nGraphite has been the go-to anode material for its ability to house\nlithium atoms in between its layers of graphene sheets. However, the\ntheoretical capacity of graphite to store lithium is limited to a single\nlithium atom per six carbon atoms (LiC$_6$). This stoichiometry\ncorresponds to a specific charge capacity of 372 mAh g$^{-1}$, assuming\none electron per lithium atom. However, silicon has the ability to take\nup a substantially greater amount of lithium in its crystal structure,\nwith a maximum of nearly four lithium atoms per silicon atom\n(Li$_{3.75}$Si), and a specific capacity of 3,600 mAh g$^{-1}$. However,\nwith this ability to eat such large amounts of lithium, silicon gets\nbloated. The periodic volumetric expansion of the anode upon charging\nand discharging (up to 320% expansion) imposes significant mechanical\nstrains on the structure of the device. The silicon must be made into\nnanowires or nanoparticles in order to accommodate the volumetric\nexpansion without cracking, but changing the form factor of the silicon\nis not without its own challenges, as the \"breathing\" of these particles\nstill have the potential to disrupt the interior structure of the cell.\nAttempts to mitigate the volumetric expansion have included the use of\ncarbon containing binders between silicon nanoparticles to increase the\nmechanical stability, however cracking still occurs. Conductive polymers\nincorporated into gels which absorb the mechanical work energy\nassociated with lithiation of silicon have recently shown some success.\nThese polymeric and gel-like binders must obviously be conductive to\nlithium ions. This requirement imposes some additional constraints on\nwhat materials can be used. Despite these challenges, silicon anodes are\nhighly desirable, and an effective strategy is to split the difference\nbetween stability and charge capacity, and to use a mixture of graphite\nand silicon.\n\n#### Alternative cathode materials\n\nIn a lithium-ion battery, the anode and cathode have a similar function:\nto store lithium atoms (Li$^0$) or ions (Li$^{+}$), respectively. Such\nmaterials permit these lithium species to **intercalate** within their\ncrystal structures. The most well known intercalation compound for use\nas the cathode is lithium cobalt oxide. Compared to alternatives\nincluding lithium nickel oxide and nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxides,\nLiCoO$_2$ has a lower capacity for lithium ions, but is more stable at\nhigh-temperature operation. Unfortunately, it is still susceptible to\nrunaway oxidation of the electrolyte, which is highly exothermic, and\ncan lead to fires. Additionally, cobalt is known as a **conflict\nmineral**. Its extraction---much of which is performed in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo---is associated with resource conflict and\nenvironmental degradation. Moreover, some mining organizations have been\nfound to be in abuse of child labor. Alternative cathode materials are\nthus under intense investigation; the target being structures made from\nelements with greater natural abundance (e.g., manganese) and which are\nless susceptible to runaway oxidation and fires.\n\n#### Metal ions\n\nLithium has many advantages as a repository of electrons and for its\nability to intercalate into graphite, silicon, and intercalation\ncompounds used at the cathode. However, lithium is relatively rare\ncompared to other alkali metals, and ancillary metals used in lithium\nion batteries---primarily copper, cobalt, and nickel---suffer from high\ncost, scarcity, and other **negative externalities** of production.\nSodium-ion batteries operate on the same principle as their\nlithium-based counterparts, but with the advantage that sodium is\nubiquitous. Consider that the ocean---a staggeringly huge amount of\nliquid---is more than 1% sodium ions, by mass! One can immediately see\nwhy this small-continent amount of sodium would be so attractive for use\nin batteries.\n\nNevertheless, sodium is much larger than lithium, and thus it is more\ndifficult to achieve high energy densities with sodium than it is with\nlithium.[^11.3.8] The difference in size between sodium and lithium require\nthe use of different electrode materials. For example, instead of\ngraphite, the anode for sodium ion batteries often uses a different\nallotrope of carbon called **hard carbon**, i.e., charcoal. Hard carbon\nis produced by heating certain types of polymers, including **lignin**,\ncarbohydrates, and other precursors in the absence of oxygen at around\n1000 $^{\\circ}$ C. What results is a highly porous, amorphous material\nthat differentiates itself from other carbonaceous allotropes in that it\ncannot be converted to graphite.[^11.3.9] Hard carbon is capable of\nincorporating sodium ions into its structure. Transfer of sodium in and\nout of the solid is made easier by the fact that hard carbon is highly\nporous.\n\nAs in lithium-ion batteries, cathodic materials for their sodium-based\nalternatives also take the form of intercalation compounds. One of the\napparent advantages of sodium-ion technology is that the cathode\nmaterials have the potential to use metals other than cobalt or nickel.\nFor example, sodium metal oxides in which the metal is either iron or\nmanganese---highly earth-abundant compared to cobalt and nickel---have\ncapacities comparable to those of common cathodes used in lithium-ion\nbatteries.\n\n[^11.3.1]: At the time of this writing, a major breakthrough was achieved in\n    the production of energy by fusion. However, most experts agree that\n    it will take quite a long time for such methods of energy production\n    to become widespread.\n\n[^11.3.2]: A fuel cell takes in a chemical fuel, e.g., hydrogen, and outputs\n    electricity and water vapor.\n\n[^11.3.3]: This naming convention between oxidation and reduction, frankly,\n    always annoyed me. The physical particle changing hands is an\n    electron, which has mass, so why would a species be \"reduced\" in any\n    way by accepting additional mass? The reason is that humans probably\n    didn't know that the negative charge was the one that actually had\n    physical mass, i.e., the electron, and that the positive charge was\n    simply the absence of this electron. \"Reduction\" comes from the fact\n    that the charge gets reduced from positive to less positive (or more\n    negative). \"Oxidation\" comes from the fact that when atoms get\n    oxygen atoms attached to them, the highly electronegative oxygen\n    atoms draw electron density away and thus the atoms to which the\n    oxygens are attached become more positive.\n\n[^11.3.4]: If you want, you can use the mnemonic \"Annie the ox\" and \"Cathy\n    the red cat.\"\n\n[^11.3.5]: I tend to think of the \"t\" in *cathode* as a positive sign, and\n    thus I remember which is which. Keep in mind however that in a solar\n    cell, the positive charges come out at the anode. The best way to\n    reconcile this apparent contradiction is that the anode is always\n    the electrode where *conventional*---i.e., positive---current enters\n    the device *most easily*. Consider large forward biases where the\n    current gets really high at positive voltages. In a solar cell, this\n    is positive current entering the anode. If you don't want to think\n    about any of this stuff, just memorize them separately: in a\n    battery, anode is negative; in a solar cell, it is positive. Sorry!\n\n[^11.3.6]: The unusual unit of kilowatt-hours means that there is enough\n    potential energy in the battery to run 100 kW worth of electrical\n    load for 1 h. Granted, the battery may not be able to discharge that\n    fast, but that's the energy capacity assuming you could. It could\n    also power 1 kW worth of electrical load over 100 h. However you\n    want to think about it. That is equivalent to running a hair dryer\n    or toaster oven for 4 days straight.\n\n[^11.3.7]: For some reason, small batteries are rated in terms of current\n    $\\times$ time. The value of 0.01 kWh is derived from a 2 ampere-hour\n    (2000 mAh) battery discharging at a potential difference of 5 V.\n\n[^11.3.8]: Note that whether the atom is lithium or sodium otherwise makes no\n    difference: both have a single ionizable electron and can be\n    oxidized only one time.\n\n[^11.3.9]: A different range of precursors, including fossilized coal or oil,\n    is heated in the absence of oxygen to generate **soft carbon**, or\n    *coke*, which can be further converted to graphite.\n",

Many of the nanoscale materials and phenomena we have\nexplored in this book are directly relevant to devices and processes\nused for the production and use of energy. This chapter provides two\ncase studies for the use of nanoscale materials which already have huge\nworldwide markets: catalysis and electrochemical energy storage in the\nform of batteries.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

Many of the nanoscale materials and phenomena we have\nexplored in this book are directly relevant to devices and processes\nused for the production and use of energy. This chapter provides two\ncase studies for the use of nanoscale materials which already have huge\nworldwide markets: catalysis and electrochemical energy storage in the\nform of batteries. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/fTv2em562tI)\n\nYou might have elected to take a class in---or major in---nanotechnology\nwith only a partial notion of the importance of this field in the modern\neconomy, and indeed in society.

Moreover, physical effects arising\nfrom the effects of size confinement are being discovered regularly and\nare often harnessed in new technologies.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Catalysis\nCatalysis, as you may remember from your high school chemistry class, is\nthe process by which a chemical reaction is sped up. In particular, in a\ncatalytic process, the **activation energy** of a chemical reaction is\nreduced. The activation energy is the \"hill\" of potential\nenergy---analogous to how your gravitational potential energy rises when\nyou climb a hill---that a reaction \"passes over\" on its way from\nreactants to products. This reduction in activation energy leads to an\naccelerated reaction rate compared to the rate of the uncatalyzed\nreaction. Critically, the potential energies of the products and\nreactants are the same; all that changes is the pathway to get there\n(see Figure (11.1)). Catalysts work by making one or both components\nmore reactive, stabilizing the transition state, or bringing the\nreactants in close proximity. Catalysts are also sometimes chemically\naltered in the process, though this alteration is temporary. Catalysts\nare typically used in a sub-stoichiometric amount, meaning a **loading**\nof a few percent or less, compared to the number of molecules of the\nreactants. Catalysts can be used in such small loadings since a single\ncatalyst molecule or catalytic site on a surface can be used again and\nagain. The number that quantifies the number of reactions affected by a\ncatalyst is the **turnover number**.\n\n(Figure 11.1) \n>>>image(catalysis.png.0)\n\n### 11.2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis\n\nCatalysts can be literally any chemical species, from a reactive site in\na porous mineral to a large enzyme. Even a single proton can be a\ncatalyst. In attempting to classify the broad range of molecules and\nmaterials that have catalytic function, the first distinction can be\nmade by whether they are dissolved in solution---**homogeneous\ncatalysts**---or supported by a solid surface or\nparticle---**heterogeneous catalysts**. Biological catalysts---generally\nenzymes---share features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncatalysts, and are often treated as occupying a third category.\n\n#### Homogeneous catalysis\n\nHomogeneous catalysts largely consist of isolated atomic and molecular\nspecies. They include protons, organocatalysts, and transition metal\ncomplexes. They are added to the reaction mixture along with the\nstarting materials in a solvent that can dissolve both the\n**substrate(s)** and the catalyst. Such catalysts are sometimes\n**organometallic** molecules consisting of a metal center surrounded by\norganic **ligands**. Often, these molecules are called **transition\nmetal complexes** because the metal atoms or ions are usually transition\nmetals (occupying that long stretch of the periodic table between the\nalkali and alkali earth metals on the left, to the \"main group\" on the\nright, which contains carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and so\nforth). That is, they belong to the class of elements with incompletely\nfilled $d$ orbitals.[^11.2.1] See Figure (11.2) for examples of famous\ncatalysts based on transition metal complexes. Advantages of homogeneous\ncatalysts include high selectivity in terms of the type of chemical\nreaction that occurs, where on the substrate molecule it occurs, and the\nsuppression of side reactions. This selectivity arises from the fact\nthat every catalyst molecule is identical. (In contrast, as we will see\nbelow, the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts have active sites which\ncan differ in structure from one to the next.)\n\n(Figure 11.2) \n>>>image(transition metal complexes.png.0)\n\nThe scope of reactions that can be affected by homogeneous catalysts is\nvast. For example, the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, the synthesis\nof polymers (sometimes the catalyst also serves as the initiator), and\nthe transformation of one functional group to another. For example,\nacids and/or bases---Arrhenius, Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry, or Lewis\ndefinition---catalyze nearly all transformations of carbonyl-containing\nfunctional groups. One special power of homogeneous catalysts is the\nability to affect **stereoselective** reactions. That is, reactions\nwhich can produce one or the other mirror image of a molecule.\nTransition metal based catalysts often have **chiral ligands**, which\naffect the direction from which the substrates may approach the\ncatalyst, and thus determine which **stereoisomer** is produced. Organic\ncatalysts---of which enzymes are a special type---also have this\nproperty. See Figure (11.3) for examples of chiral molecules. That is,\nmolecules whose mirror images are actually different compounds because\nthey have different orientations in space.\n\n(Figure 11.3) \n>>>image(enantiomers.png.0)\n\nHomogeneous catalysts have one major drawback: they are difficult to\nrecover after the reaction. Whereas a heterogeneous catalyst is usually\na solid and can often be recovered simply by filtration, a homogeneous\ncatalyst is dissolved in solution and is difficult to separate from the\nproducts and reactants. The difficulty in removing so as to reuse the\ncatalyst is compounded by the instability of the catalyst molecules.\nThat is, homogeneous catalysts with active sites containing transition\nmetal atoms or ions are often unstable to air and water. Thus, methods\nof aqueous extraction are incompatible with this type of catalyst. In\nfact, in most chemical processes involving homogeneous catalysts based\non metals, the catalyst is destroyed when the reaction is **quenched**\n(meaning stoppage of the reaction by the addition of water, another a\npolar solvent, or a specific chemical species which deactivates the\ncatalyst or the reactants). A homogeneous catalyst also generally\nrequires the use of a solvent, whereas heterogeneous systems can act\ndirectly on neat liquids and mixtures of gases.\n\n#### Heterogeneous catalysis\n\nHeterogeneous catalysis means that there is more than one phase present\nin the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous catalyst itself is usually a\nsolid, and can act upon substrates present in either the liquid (or\nsolution) or gas phase. Compared to the reactions affected by\nhomogeneous catalysts, the types of reactions brought about by\nheterogeneous catalysts are somewhat more limited. For example,\noxidation and reduction reactions and simple functional group\ntransformations are relatively straightforward to accomplish. Highly\nselective reactions---such as those that can synthesize only one mirror\nimage of a compound---are difficult to achieve. The lack of selectivity\ncomes from the random arrangement and shapes of active sites in\ncatalytic particles and surfaces. Whereas the shape of the active site\nin every molecule of a homogeneous catalyst is identical, in a\nheterogeneous catalyst, there is a range of shapes.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of transformations in chemical\nmanufacturing by sheer tonnage of products is accomplished using\nheterogeneous processes. What heterogeneous catalysts lack in\nselectivity and specificity, they make up for in recyclability and\nthroughput. For example, it is a simple matter to remove catalyst\nparticles from a suspension by filtration. Moreover, if the catalyst is\nimmobilized on the inside surface of a reaction vessel---as in a\ncatalytic converter in an automobile, see below---the catalyst need not\nbe removed at all. Under favorable circumstances, catalyst molecules\nusually used in homogeneous settings can be immobilized on the surfaces\nof polymeric microbeads. This approach preserves the selectivity of the\nhomogeneous catalyst with the recyclability of catalysts in\nheterogeneous systems.\n\n### 11.2.2. Chemical manufacturing\n\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical manufacturing. Almost no commodity\nnor fine chemical compound (especially polymers, pharamaceuticals, and\nother organic molecules) can be produced without the use of catalysts.\nProducts with useful levels of complexity just don't form on their own\nwithout the lowering of the activation barriers by catalysts. In fact,\neven most bulk, commodity chemicals (think mineral acids like sulfuric\nacid) are produced using catalysts. Chemical \"cracking\" of longer-chain\nhydrocarbons into shorter chain ones in the petrochemical industry is\nperformed using high heat and the use of catalysts. Carbon-carbon bonds\nsimply do not break by themselves, even if the products have lower\npotential energy than the reactants. Such reactions are simply too slow,\nbecause the activation energy barrier on the way from reactants to\nproducts is too high.\n\nSome of the industrial processes with the largest impacts on society are\nin the form of chemical manufacturing using catalysts. Chemical refining\ncould not occur without significant help from catalysts. Polymers, along\nwith the chemical starting materials from which they arise, are\ngenerated using catalytic processes. A synthetic drug molecule may have\nbeen manufactured as the result of 10-20 synthetic steps, most of which\nwere catalyzed. However, one of the most important industrial process\nproduces a simple product---ammonia, NH$_3$---without which modern life\non planet earth would not be possible.\n\n#### Haber-Bosch process\n\nThe element of nitrogen is required for nearly everything, from the\nproduction of fertilizers in agriculture to the synthesis of nitric acid\nfor the manufacturing of explosives. However, most nitrogen is locked up\nin the atmosphere as nitrogen gas, dinitrogen (N$_2$), one of the most\ninert gases known. It might as well be a noble gas! For decades,\nnitrogen was obtained from mineral salts such as niter (KNO$_3$).\nAlternatively, it could be extracted from guano (literally, bat poop) in\ntropical caves. With the spreading of the industrial revolution,\nlarge-scale agriculture, and the need for weapons for World War I, the\ndemand for nitrogen atoms became intense.\n\nIt was in this climate that Fritz Haber invented what became known as\nthe **Haber Process**, which generates ammonia from dinitrogen and\nhydrogen gas. In the first sequence of reactions, many of which employ\nheterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen is generated. This hydrogen is reacted\n(again with the help of heterogeneous catalysts) with dinitrogen from\nthe air to produce ammonia. Ammonia is a highly valuable product, as it\ncan be used as the nitrogen source for a wide range of chemical\ntransformations. It is such an important compound industrially that it\nconsumes a vast amount of the world's energy resources: 1 percent of the\nenergy and 1.5 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n### 11.2.3. Catalysis in biology\n\nBiology is the ultimate proof-of-concept for the power and versatility\nof catalysis, and of nanoengineering more broadly. From simple starting\nmaterials---carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and energy from sunlight\n(and in some cases hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean---all of\nbiological structure and diversity is achieved. Metabolism, sensation,\nreproduction, self-healing, consciousness, creativity, and all other\nanimal characteristics are all ultimately products of biochemical\nprocesses. Thus, biology itself serves as a model for what systems of\nhighly selective nanostructured catalysts can do.\n\n#### Enzymes\n\nIn the 1980s, visionary scientist Dr. K. Eric Drexler envisioned a\nfuture dominated by molecular assemblers---nanoscopic machines akin to\nindustrial robots, but which could assemble molecules and ultimately\nmaterials and devices atom by atom. The idea of a molecular assembler\nstirred the imagination of many readers and was really a boon to the\nfield of nanotechnology. However, the idea was met with derision by\nothers. For example, some chemists point to the fact that chemical\nreactions are required to transfer one atom to another. Moreover, such\nreactions are done routinely on the scale of many tonnes with high\nselectivity. Physical chemist and Nobel laureate Richard Smalley pointed\nto the \"sticky fingers\" of a molecular assembler, by which he meant that\nit would be difficult to detach atoms from the assembler to the\nsubstrate because of strong van der Waals interactions. The strongest\ncriticism, however, comes from biology, where catalysts based on folded\nproteins and nucleic acids---**enzymes** and **ribozymes**---already\nhave many of the characteristics of molecular assemblers. We explore the\nproperties of this extraordinarily important class of catalysts, here.\n\nEssentially all chemical transformations carried out inside biological\nsystems are made possible by enzymes.[^11.2.2] Enzymes are the primary type\nof biological catalyst, and are made primarily of proteins. Like other\nproteins, enzymes have a **primary structure** consisting of a sequence\nof amino acids, a **secondary structures** consisting of\n$\\alpha$-helices and $\\beta$-sheets, a **tertiary structure** consisting\nof disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (called a cystine disulfide\nbond), and a **quaternary structure** consisting of multiple polypeptide\nsubunits stuck together.\n\nThe part of the enzyme that binds the **substrate(s)** is called the\n**active site**, Figure (11.4). The active site, as in any catalyst,\nmust immobilize the reactant(s), affect a chemical change, and then\nrelease the products. Just like any catalyst, an enzyme might undergo a\nconformational reorganization and/or chemical change during the process,\nbut such a change is temporary. The hallmark of a catalyst is that it is\nunchanged before and after the reaction it facilitates, so that it can\nbe used again and again. The active site has a shape that is\ncomplementary to the shape of the transition state between reactants and\nproducts. Inside the active site, the range of chemical functionality\nafforded by the backbone of a polypeptide chain and on the R groups of\nthe amino acids are exploited to the fullest extent possible. That is,\nlone pairs of oxygen atoms in the carbonyl groups and N--H groups along\nthe backbone, formal negative charges of aspartate and glutamate\nresidues, and formal positive charges of lysine, arginine, and histidine\nresidues, can be used to bond electrostatically to substrates. These\ninteractions are used to immobilize reactants in the active site, but\nalso to bring them in a position where they are more likely to react to\nform products.\n\n(Figure 11.4) \n>>>image(active site.png.0)\n\nWe note that the electrostatic interactions between an enzyme and its\nsubstrate(s) tend to be stronger than suggested by the van der Waals\ncomponent consisting of dipole-dipole interactions given in Chapter 2.\nThe reason is that van der Waals forces assume the freedom for the\nmolecules containing permanent dipoles to rotate. This free rotation has\nthe effect of reducing the overall interaction energy between molecules\nwith permanent dipoles. Hence, the dipole-dipole force depends on\ntemperature, as a greater temperature unlocks a greater range of\norientations that a dipole can adopt in an electric field. However, when\na molecule is immobilized by multiple electrostatic and steric\ninteractions---like a key in a lock---it is no longer able to rotate\nfreely. Elimination of free rotation makes the electrostatic\ninteractions dominate even the London dispersion interaction, which we\ntold you in Chapter 2 was the dominant component of the van der Waals\ninteraction for all but the smallest molecules with strong dipole\nmoments. Thus, once a substrate is in the active site, it is locked in\ntightly.\n\nOne of the aspects of the active site which affects its ability to\ncatalyze reactions is its shape. As it happens, the shape of the active\nsite is complementary not to the reactant(s) or product(s), but rather\nto the shape of the **transition state**. Remember, the purpose of an\nenzyme---or any catalyst, for that matter---is to lower the potential\nenergy of the transition state. The energy of the transition state is\ndirectly related to the speed of the reaction by the Arrhenius equation,\nequation (11.1), below\n\n(Equation 11.1) $$k=A\\exp{\\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$$\n\nwhere $E_a$ is the activation energy. Thus, by making itself\ncomplementary to the transition state, the total electrostatic potential\nenergy can be lowered and the reaction rate will increase. Figure (11.4)\nshows a schematic diagram of the shape of the active site and its effect\non the electrostatic potential energy of the transition state. The rate\nof reaction of an enzyme is often characterized by the method of\nMichaelis and Menten: Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While we will not go\ninto the topic here, you will learn all about it if you take a course in\nbiochemistry.\n\n#### Industrial biocatalysis\n\nBiological enzymes are used ubiquitously in industrial processes. One\nexample we will highlight is in **chiral resolution**. For example, the\nenzyme lipase[^11.2.3] catalyzes the formation of ester bonds from carboxylic\nacids and hydroxyl groups. When I (Darren) was an undergraduate\nresearcher, my project was to synthesize a natural product called\n\"basiliskamide A.\" This molecule was originally isolated from a\nbacterium that lived inside a sea sponge (or something) off the coast of\nPapua New Guinea. When new natural products are discovered, they are\noften screened against an array of bacteria and other disease targets.\nBasiliskamide A (Figure (11.5), along with its related isomer,\nbasiliskamide B) was found to have activity against two types of\nfungi---*Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Candida albicans*. These two fungi\nare not very dangerous to people with healthy immune systems (*C\nalbicans* causes diaper rash, which we've all had at some point in our\nlives), but for those with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV-AIDS\npatients, chemotherapy patients, etc.), infections can be deadly.\n\n(Figure 11.5) \n>>>image(basiliskamides.png.0)\n\nBasiliskamide a is a pretty small, unassuming natural product. You\nwouldn't base an entire PhD thesis on making it from scratch. But, it\nwas a good project for an undergraduate. However, there was a highly\nchallenging aspect to the synthesis. Namely, the series of four\n**stereogenic centers** located in the red box in Figure (11.5). The\nlaboratory in which I did my undergraduate research specialized in\nmaking these linear sequences of **stereogenic** carbon atoms.[^11.2.4] All\nthe atoms need to be attached in precisely the right way, otherwise the\nmolecule will cease to have its biological activity.\n\nIn order to generate stereogenic centers, you need to have\n**enantiomerically enriched** starting materials. That is, materials\nwhere the overwhelming majority of molecules have the same 3D\norientation in space. There are very few ways to generate this type of\nchiral (handed) information from scratch: most enantiomerically pure\ncompounds are the result of biological processes, because amino\nacids---and thus enzymes---exist as only one chiral form in biology.\nHowever, certain kinds of starting materials can be prepared in\nunnatural conditions using enzymes that are stolen from biology. One\nsuch class of enzymes, the lipase, catalyzes either the conversion or\nbreakdown of esters into carboxylic acids (fatty acids, hence \"lip\"ase)\nand free alcohols. The key to this kind of reaction when catalyzed by an\nenzyme, is that it only acts on one mirror image of the starting\nmaterials. One **enantiomer** is converted to an ester, and the other\nremains as a free alcohol. The difference in polarity make them easy to\nseparate.\n\nThis kind of **chiral resolution** is a common process in pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing. The beauty of the process is the fact that the purity is\noutstanding with typically \\>99% of the compound with the desired 3D\narrangement. However, one complication may arise. Consider that enzymes\nevolved in biological systems and thus aqueous environments. Most\nbuilding blocks of drug molecules are not actually soluble in water.\nBelieve it or not, many lipases can actually function just fine in a\nnonpolar solvent such as hexane. Such molecules, even when \"dry,\" hold\nonto enough water molecules such that they can maintain their 3D shape\nand functionality. The enzymes---as they swim around in the nonpolar\nsolvent---are embedded in a capsule of water (Figure (11.6)). This\nenvironment follows the enzyme around wherever it goes in the nonpolar\nmedium. The hydrated lipase enzyme can thus be thought of as a nanorobot\nor roving molecular assembler!\n\n(Figure 11.6) \n>>>image(lipase.png.0)\n\nBiocatalysis in industry and in the R&D laboratory is not limited to\nlipase enzymes. That is, not every reaction involves the separation of\ndifferent enantiomers of alcohols. Modern tools of **genetic\nengineering** and **directed evolution** can be used to design unnatural\nenzymes to carry out a particular reaction. Whole organisms such as\nyeasts can also be used as biocatalysts, e.g., for the enantioselective\nconversion of carbonyl groups (as in Figure (11.6)b) into alcohols.\nBiocatalytic systems can also be engineered---**biochemical\nengineering**---to produce whole natural product molecules. Such an\napproach often uses genetically engineered microorganisms. Engineers can\nco-opt the biosynthetic, enzymatic pathways already present in the\nmicroorganism for the production of useful and high-value molecules,\nsuch as pharmaceutical precursors or even whole drug molecules.\n\n### 11.2.4. Catalysts in environmental remediation\n\nAs we have seen, catalytic processes are required to affect all but the\nsimplest chemical reactions, or at least in affecting them in any kind\nof reasonable timescale. Sometimes catalysts are used not in the\nproduction of useful chemicals, but for the de-toxification of unwanted\nbyproducts. Nanostructured catalytic particles and surfaces with\nnanostructures can have such a high ratio of surface area to volume that\nthey can even be used to react with toxic gases in real time. In fact,\nthe economic sectors of heavy industry and transportation would leave\nthe atmosphere a toxic mess were it not for nanoscopic bits of metal\nthat act as catalysts. Consider the **scrubbers** that remove toxic\ncompounds from flue gas (industrial exhaust). One such implementation of\nthis type of nano-enabled environmental remediation is in the area of\n**catalytic converters** found in cars, construction vehicles, and other\nheavy equipment.\n\n#### Catalytic converters\n\nWhen gasoline is combusted in an automobile engine, the ideal products\nare carbon dioxide and water.\n\n$$\\text{C}_{n}\\text{H}_{2n+2} + n\\text{O}_2 = n\\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\n\nHowever, reality is seldom ideal. Nearly always, what gets produced is a\nmixture of, sure, mostly carbon dioxide and water, but also unreacted or\npartially reacted hydrocarbons, incompletely oxidized carbon in the form\nof carbon monoxide (CO), and products involving oxidized nitrogen\n(NO$_{x}$, pronounced \"nox\"). Of these chemicals, unreacted hydrocarbons\ncontribute to global warming much more on a gram-per-gram basis than\ndoes carbon dioxide. Next, carbon monoxide is toxic to humans[^11.2.5].\nFinally, release of NO$_{x}$, consisting of NO and NO$_{2}$, along with\nCO, drives atmospheric pollution.\n\nThese compounds themselves (with the exception perhaps of carbon\nmonoxide) are not particularly harmful. However, they are the starting\npoints for the formation of other pollutants. In particular, a cascade\nof chemical reactions involving these starting materials, when combined\nwith sunlight and naturally occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\nproduce acid rain, ground-level ozone, and smog. Smog---a *portmanteau*\nof \"smoke\" and \"fog\"---contains a large fraction of particulate matter\n(PM). These structures, especially with sizes of 2.5 $\\mu$m or less (\"PM\n2.5\"), are particularly hazardous. These micron and nanometer scale\nparticles can form from the combustion of solid material in the open air\n(forest fires, electricity production from coal, burned biomass, or\nfireplace fires) or from the polymerization or aggregation of VOCs\nactivated ultimately by NO$_{x}$, CO, and sunlight. Exposure to\natmospheric pollution---especially PM 2.5---is responsible for millions\nof premature deaths per year, worldwide.\n\nGiven that much of this deleterious effect on lifespan is the result of\nhuman activity, society has implicitly accepted such risks as a matter\nof normal economic activity and growth. However, there are some things\nthat technology can do to mitigate these risks. One of the greatest\nadditions to the **internal combustion engine**---and indeed gas-driven\nturbines used for electricity generation and industrial uses---is the\n**catalytic converter**. In a \"three-way\" catalytic converter,\nhydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are chemically oxidized fully, up to\nCO$_{2}$, while NO$_{x}$ is reduced to N$_{2}$ in the presence of\ncarbon, hydrocarbons, or carbon monoxide, which itself is oxidized up to\nCO$_{2}$ in the process, see Figure (11.7).\n\n(Figure 11.7) \n>>>image(catalytic converter.png.0)\n\nThe catalytic converter itself is a box with an arrangement of support\nstructures coated with inorganic ceramic particles. These particles,\ncalled the **wash coat**, comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and/or silica\n(SiO$_2$). Once applied, the wash coat contains a nanoscopically rough\nsurface.[^11.2.6] This surface is used as the substrate for the support of\nprecious metal particles, which perform the actual catalytic work. In\nparticular, a mixture of palladium (oxidation reactions), rhodium\n(reduction reactions), and platinum (oxidation or reduction reactions)\nis used.[^11.2.7] The oxidation and reduction reactions are driven at high\ntemperature (a few hundred $^{\\circ}$ C) and thus the converter is\nplaced relatively close to the exhaust manifold emanating from the\nengine.\n\n[^11.2.1]: Though some will say that to qualify as *organometallic*, there\n    must be an actual bond between a metal atom and a carbon atom, but\n    we will not be so exclusive.\n\n[^11.2.2]: We won't make a distinction in this book between enzymes made from\n    proteins and those made from nucleic acids. Even though some types\n    of biological catalysts contain both protein and nucleic acid\n    components. Some of these hybrid structures are even able to\n    catalyze reactions with their nucleic acids only!\n\n[^11.2.3]: The suffix \"ase\" indicates that it is an enzyme.\n\n[^11.2.4]: The presence of a stereogenic carbon atom makes a molecule chiral.\n    That is, the molecule has a mirror image that is not superimposable\n    on the original. A stereogenic center is usually a carbon atom with\n    four different groups attached to it, which can be atoms like\n    hydrogen, oxygen, or chlorine, or organic groups such as a methyl\n    group, an isopropyl group, or a benzene ring.\n\n[^11.2.5]: Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin more strongly than oxygen and\n    can lead to rapid suffocation at high enough concentrations\n\n[^11.2.6]: Just like an English muffin, full of nooks and crannies.\n\n[^11.2.7]: The high price of the metals used in catalytic converters make\n    them a frequent target of theft.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Batteries\nA future society based on abundant, renewable energy sources such as\nfrom wind and solar require a place to store the energy once it is\ngenerated. The reason that storage is needed is that these sources are\nintermittent. The wind isn't always blowing and the sun is really only\nat its brightest from around 10 am to 4 pm. In contrast, fossil fuels\nsuch as coal and natural gas can be burned whenever. Their physical form\nsolves the storage issue automatically. Thus, we need to find a way to\nbuffer electricity demand during the times in which energy from wind and\nsolar is not being generated.[^11.3.1] Many potential solutions have been\nproposed, such as pumping water \"uphill\" or into dams and then releasing\nit after the sun goes down to generate \"on demand\" hydroelectric power.\nIndeed, this approach is gaining traction. Other solutions involve\nconverting excess energy generated during windy and sunny times into\nchemical fuels, such as hydrogen, which when burned in an engine or\n**fuel cell**[^11.3.2] can be used to generate electricity. However, perhaps\nthe most attractive mechanism for portable energy storage is by\nmanipulating electrochemical potentials. That is, batteries. Modern\nbattery technologies, exemplified in the now-ubiquitous lithium ion\ntype, are full of examples of nanoengineered systems. We examine the\nbasics, below.\n\n### 11.3.1. Operation of batteries\n\nA battery operates by manipulating the natural tendencies of some atoms,\nmolecules, or materials to want to give up electrons and the tendencies\nof other materials to accept these electrons. Those species which give\nup electrons are said to be **oxidized** in the process, while those\nthat accept electrons are said to be **reduced**.[^11.3.3] When electrons\nflow from one **half cell** to the other, when connected by a wire, the\nelectrochemical potential can be captured to power a load. The battery\nstops working when the two half cells are at thermodynamic equilibrium,\nand there is no longer any tendency for electrons to go from one\nmaterial to the other. We explore the operation of a battery in more\ndetail, below.\n\n#### Definitions\n\nA battery comprises two **half-cells**---an oxidation half-cell and a\nreduction half-cell. The oxidation half-cell consists of a material with\na strong tendency to give up electrons and the reduction half-cell is a\nmaterial that accepts these electrons. You may have heard the terms\n**anode** and **cathode**. The anode is the site of oxidation and the\ncathode is the site of reduction.[^11.3.4] The anode is thus the negatively\ncharged electrode and the cathode is the positively charged one.[^11.3.5] The\nquintessential battery consists of one or more **galvanic cells**. A\ngalvanic or voltaic cell consists of two elemental metals with different\noxidation potentials. These metal **electrodes** are immersed in\nseparate beakers in **electrolyte solution**. The electrodes are\nconnected to a voltmeter or **load** (like a light bulb) using a wire.\nThe beakers are connected using a **salt bridge** which can be, for\nexample, a glass tube filled with a **hydrogel** saturated with a\nsolution of an inert salt.\n\nThe classic example of a galvanic cell has a zinc anode and a copper\ncathode. The oxidation half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-}$$\n\nAnd the reduction half reaction is\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\\text{e}^{-} = \\text{Cu}^0$$\n\nFor an overall reaction of\n\n$$\\text{Cu}^{2+} + \\text{Zn}^0 = \\text{Cu}^0 + \\text{Zn}^{2+}$$\n\nOnce this system is in place, electrons flow from the zinc (which wants\nto be oxidized) to the wire, through the load, to the copper (which\nwants to be reduced). Charge neutrality must be maintained, otherwise a\nhuge excess of positive charge would build up at the anodic half cell\nand vice versa. The system maintains charge neutrality by the drift of\nions through the salt bridge. In the example drawn in Figure (11.8), the\nions that migrate are sulfate.\n\n(Figure 11.8) \n>>>image(zinc-copper.png.0)\n\nThe voltage of the cell can be determined by summing up the oxidation\npotentials of the two half reactions. The electrochemical potential\nenergies of metals is tabulated in the form of the **reduction\npotential**, not the oxidation potential. Thus the potential energy of\nthe whole cell is given by\n\n$$E_{total} = E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$$\n\nIn this case, the standard reduction potential of zinc is -0.76 V and\nthe standard reduction potential of copper is 0.34 V. The total\npotential of the galvanic cell is thus 1.10 V. When we say *standard*\nreduction potential, we are making a reference to the **standard\nhydrogen electrode**, which involves the reaction of two protons with\ntwo electrons to form H$_2$, or hydrogen gas.\n\n#### Key figures of merit: Power and energy\n\nIn modern technology, you may sometimes hear, in jest, the mantra\n*better, faster, cheaper!*. For battery technologies, you could be a bit\nmore specific, and say *more energy density, more power density, safer,\nlighter, and more earth-abundant*. There are other key figures of merit\nas well.\n\n**Energy density** refers to the total amount of potential energy that\ncan be stored in the electrochemical cells per unit mass. It is the\ntotal capacity of the battery. For example, the lithium-ion batteries\ninside electric vehicles might have a total capacity of 100\nkilowatt-hours (kWh) or 360 megajoules (MJ).[^11.3.6] The capacity of the\nbattery in your phone is closer to 0.01 kWh.[^11.3.7]\n\n**Power density** refers to the speed at which the energy can be\nextracted from the battery. Power, in terms of watts, or joules per\nsecond, is dependent on the molecular level processes occurring in the\nelectrochemical cells. That is, oxidation and reduction at the\nelectrodes, along with transport and diffusion of electrons and ions\nbetween the two half-cells.\n\nThe energy and power densities are often expressed in terms of\n**specific energy** and **specific power** in units of J kg$^{-1}$ or W\nkg$^{-1}$. Note that these densities are per mass (gravimetric) not per\nvolume (volumetric). The specific energies and the specific powers for\nenergy storage devices are often regarded to be in competition. For\nexample, a capacitor can deliver power very quickly (think of a camera\nflash), but cannot store very much energy because it can only hold a\nthin layer of charge at the surface of metallic films. Alternatively, a\nfuel cell which converts hydrogen to electricity discharges very slowly\nbut has a ton of potential energy stored in its chemical bonds (i.e., of\nH$_2$). A convenient way to visualize the energy density and power\ndensity is the Ragone (rah-GO-nee) plot, see Figure (11.9).\n\n(Figure 11.9) \n>>>image(ragone.png.0)\n\nDespite the strong correlation between specific energy and specific\npower, there is still room for optimization. Much of this latitude is\nafforded by, you guessed it, nanoengineering of the electrode materials.\nWe look at the special case of lithium ion batteries, below.\n\n### 11.3.2. Lithium-ion batteries: materials selection\n\nLithium ion batteries operate by the movement of lithium ions (Li$^+$)\nand electrons (e$^-$) between two half cells. One half cell, the anode,\ncontains graphite and lithium atoms (Li$^0$). The other half cell, the\ncathode, contains lithium metal (often cobalt) oxide (see Figure\n(11.10)). The two half cells are separated by a membrane electrolyte\nwhich is permeable to lithium ions. In normal operation, when the cells\nare fully charged, the lithium metal atoms on the anode side give up\ntheir electrons. The graphite is connected to a copper film, which\nitself is connected to a wire. The electron exits the anode into the\ncopper film and thence to a wire, where the current flow can be used to\npower an electrical load. Meanwhile, the lithium ions traverse the\nelectrolyte **separator** to the cathode half-cell. The cathode\nhalf-cell consists of an **intercalation compound**, of which the\narchetype is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO$_2$). The cathode is supported\nby a film of metal, typically aluminum. The electrons---after passing\nthrough the wire connecting the two half cells---enter the cathode and\nreduce the lithium ions back to lithium metal. When the battery is\n(re)charged, a positive bias is applied to the cathode. Electrons leave\nthe lithium metal and the lithium ions that are created migrate back\nover to the anode and take up residence between the graphene sheets of\nthe graphite anode.\n\n(Figure 11.10) \n>>>image(lithium ion.png.0)\n\n#### Anodes\n\nThe graphene sheets that make up the graphite are the perfect home for\nthe small lithium atoms. Recall that in a classical galvanic cell, the\nmetal ions either detach upon oxidation or deposit by reduction onto the\nelectrodes themselves. The metal electrodes either shrink or increase in\nmass, depending on the direction of the flow of current. It is actually\nthe negatively charged counterion in the electrolyte solution that\nmigrates via the salt bridge to balance the excess of charge. In a\nlithium-ion battery, the solid electrodes consist of graphite and\nlithium cobalt oxide. Both materials are able to accommodate lithium\nspecies within their solid structures. Thus, these materials can be\ndischarged and charged again while the changes to their structures are\nnominally reversible.\n\nDespite its popularity as an anode material, graphite has a somewhat low\nspecific capacity, owing to its low volumetric change upon lithiation.\nIn contrast, silicon can undergo a very large increase in volume\n(5$\\times$) and thus accommodate many more lithium atoms. Challenges to\nthe use of silicon anodes are indeed related to this large and\nreversible volumetric change. This cycling in size can lead to cracking,\nand thus polymeric binders that are permeable to ions must be\nengineered. Nevertheless, silicon anodes are used in the commercial\nmarket, with increased specific charge associated with, for example,\ngreater range in electric vehicles.\n\n#### Cathodes\n\nThe conventional cathode of lithium cobalt oxide is known as an\n**intercalation compound**, which means that some species---in this case\nlithium atoms---can slide into the crystal structure. These materials\nare selected for various applications on the basis of either total\ncapacity of charge storage or the speed with which the charges can be\nextracted. For example, while cathodes based on lithium cobalt oxide\nmight be the best for relatively low-power devices like smartphones and\nlaptops, they may not be the best for electric vehicles, which require a\nlot of power quickly. Researchers are constantly looking for new types\nof intercalation compounds that can shuttle ions in and out of their\ncrystal structures quickly.\n\n### 11.3.3. Case study: electric vehicles\n\nIndeed the ability to move lithium ions and atoms in and out of the\nelectrodes is hugely important for the electrification of the economy.\nMuch of the energy usage associated with carbon emissions and thus\nglobal climate change comes through the transportation sector of the\neconomy. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take a majority of the\nmarket share of new vehicles sold in the United States by around\n2030-2035. The expectation of huge growth is supported by (1)\nenvironmental regulation, (2) consumer tax incentives, and (3) the fact\nthat many aspects of ownership of EVs are superior to those of vehicles\npowered by an **internal combustion engine (ICE)**. The electrification\nof the transportation sector of the economy is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of strategies for the electrochemical storage of\nenergy---i.e., batteries. As you know, batteries have been used in\nautomobiles for many decades. Headlights, radios, and power windows have\nalways required electricity. Nevertheless, the movement of vehicles\nweighing thousands of pounds over ranges of hundreds of miles has\nrequired the development of new types of battery technologies.\n\n#### Oldie but goodie: The lead-acid battery\n\nVehicles have had electrical components for around a century.\nHeadlights, indoor lighting, audio equipment, and operation of the\ninstrument clusters use a **lead-acid** battery (starting, lighting, and\nignition, the \"SLI\" tasks). The lead acid battery was invented in the\nmid-nineteenth century, and was the first **rechargeable** battery to be\ndiscovered. It may be surprising to learn that essentially all low\n(12-volt) applications in automobiles are still powered by the lead-acid\nbattery, and to this day this ancient technology represents around 50%\nof the market share of batteries sold in the world.\n\nA lead-acid battery consists of an elemental (i.e., metallic) lead\nelectrode separated by an electrolyte, sometimes a gel, containing\nsulfuric acid. The cathode consists of lead oxide (PbO$_2$). In\noperation, excess electrons travel from the metallic lead through an\nexternal wire to power the peripheral devices of the car. The lead oxide\nis reduced by the electrons returning to the cathode. During this\nreduction reaction, an oxygen ion (O$^{2-}$) is ejected. It quickly\npicks up two acidic hydrogen ions (protons) from the sulfuric acid, and\nbecomes water. The naked sulfate ion that is produced migrates through\nthe liquid or gel electrolyte to the anode, where the lead atoms that\nlost their two electrons combine with the sulfate to become lead\nsulfate. (Actually, both the anode and the cathode when fully discharged\nbecome lead sulfate.) The equilibration of the electrochemical\npotentials leads to a **dead battery**. The **alternator** of the car\nturns excess mechanical energy into electrical potential that is used to\nrecharge the battery.\n\nIt is tempting to think of the architecture of the lead acid battery as\na textbook galvanic cell with wires connected to thick slabs of lead and\nlead oxide separated by an electrolyte. In reality, however, a car\nbattery has a hierarchical structure. The anodes and cathodes are made\ninto thin plates covered by a nanoporous separator membrane that allows\nions through prevents contact and thus short circuiting of the\nelectrodes. Groups of plates are slid into place in an interdigitated\nstructure like two combs or the opposing sides of a zipper. In this\nstructure, the anode and cathode materials alternate. The purpose of\nthis structure is to increase the total surface area to permit facile\ncharging and discharging. The space between the interdigitated\nelectrodes is filled with an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. Other\nstructures---e.g., concentric cylinders---are used for other\napplications.\n\nEach cell in a lead-acid battery has a nominal voltage of 2.1 V. To\nachieve a total voltage of 12 V, six of these cells are connected in\nseries, with the negative terminal (anode) of one cell connected to the\npositive terminal (cathode) of the next. The lead-acid battery is\ncapable of around 500 full discharge cycles before it must be replaced.\nThe finite lifetime of a lead-acid battery is the result of the\nformation of a crystallized form of lead sulfate that forms at both the\nanode and the cathode which, unlike amorphous lead sulfate, does not\nrevert back to the pure lead and lead oxide phases when recharged. Once\nthis unwanted process of **sulfation** is completed, the battery is\ndead.\n\n#### The lithium-ion \"traction\" battery\n\nAll hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric vehicles also have a\nlarger, more powerful battery on board. This is the so-called **traction\nbattery**, because it is used not to power the ignition and the\nrelatively low-power lights and peripherals in the passenger cabin, but\nthe wheels. The fact that electric vehicles even had two batteries for\ndifferent purposes was made strikingly clear to me on a recent camping\ntrip in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park near San Diego. In order to unload\nour food, drinks, tent, and other accessories, we left the lift gate of\nour plugin hybrid vehichle open, and didn't close it for several hours.\nUnbeknownst to me, the opening of the lift gate engaged all kinds of\nelectronic circuits in the inside of the car. I had believed that the 10\nkWh battery---half full at the time we parked---would make the phrase\n\"dead battery\" a thing of the past, at least for drivers of cars with\nbig lithium ion batteries. It turns out that this battery has a highly\nspecialized purpose, and that it is to power the wheels, and little\nelse. Apparently, the lead-acid battery needs to have charge even to\nturn the car on! By leaving the lift gate open, I had depleted the\nlead-acid battery and the car would not even start. Thankfully, we had a\n12-volt battery pack with us that we had purchased to jump a different\ncar left unused in our garage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We had\nbrought this battery to charge our USB devices, and were able to use it\nto start the car.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, along with functionally equivalent\nlithium-polymer batteries (which use a polymeric electrolyte), have\nhigher energy densities than lead-acid batteries and also longer\nlifetimes. They can in general be discharged deeper with less\ndegradation in capacity. Traction batteries with capacities of 200 V can\nbe produced by combining many **cells** with nominal voltages of 3 to 4\nV in various arrangements into the **battery pack**. Lithium-ion\nbatteries are considered a technology of moderate maturity, which means\nthat there are many avenues for potential discovery and improvement.\n\n### 11.3.4. Areas for discovery\n\nBattery technologies---and in particular those based on the lithium-ion\nconcept---are still in a rich phase of research and development. Many\nuniversity and industrial laboratories are working to increase the power\ndensity, energy density, lifetime, safety, recyclability, and\nenvironmental burden of the components. Here, we highlight a few areas\nwhich represent potentially fruitful avenues which are receiving\nsignificant attention and research funding.\n\n#### The solid electrolyte interface\n\nOne of the chief reasons that a lithium-ion battery loses its capacity\nover its lifetime is because of unwanted reactions at the surface of the\nanode. These reactions occur because of the high reduction potential of\nthe anode and thus its ability to react with molecules within the\nelectrolyte. Eventually, this process leads to the formation of a crusty\nsubstance at the surface of the anode. This crust contains many types of\ncompounds and a composition and morphology that depends on the identity\nof the molecules in the electrolyte. This crust is called the **solid\nelectrolyte interface (SEI)**. The formation of the SEI is regarded as\ninevitable, but it is nevertheless the object of intense study.\nCharacterization of the compounds that form at the SEI and examination\nof the way in which the compounds within the battery influence its\nmorphology could lead to better selection of materials or architecture\nof the device. In particular, designs that slow the growth of the SEI or\nallow its growth to proceed in a more predictable manner are desirable.\n\nThere are several ways in which the SEI has undesirable consequences on\nthe performance of a lithium-ion battery over time. For example, as the\nanode reduces the molecules of the electrolyte---often carbonate\nsolvents---electron-rich products are formed. To balance the charge,\npositively charged lithium ions become incorporated in these products.\nThe formation of these lithium-containing compounds is irreversible and\nleads to a reduction in **lithium inventory** in the cell. Since lithium\natoms and ions are the currency of the battery, sequestration of lithium\nin the SEI is equivalent to taking money out of the economy by putting\nit under your mattress and then forgetting about it. Another way in\nwhich the SEI reduces the effectiveness of the battery is by blocking\nthe migration of lithium into and out of the anode. This characteristic\nof the SEI may reduce the power density. A final way in which the SEI\nacts to reduce the efficiency of the battery may be counterintuitive.\nThat is, the SEI may be electrically conductive. Greater conductivity of\nelectrons means a greater rate of unwanted electrochemical reduction of\nthe compounds making up the electrolyte. This increase leads to greater\ngrowth rate of the SEI, and thus a greater degradation of the\nelectrolyte, loss of lithium inventory, decreased rate of lithium\nexchange with the anode, and so on. Thus, understanding the composition\nof the SEI, its material properties, and methods to limit its formation\nare key to increased usage of lithium-ion batteries in transportation\nand grid-scale energy storage.\n\n#### Alternative anode materials\n\nGraphite has been the go-to anode material for its ability to house\nlithium atoms in between its layers of graphene sheets. However, the\ntheoretical capacity of graphite to store lithium is limited to a single\nlithium atom per six carbon atoms (LiC$_6$). This stoichiometry\ncorresponds to a specific charge capacity of 372 mAh g$^{-1}$, assuming\none electron per lithium atom. However, silicon has the ability to take\nup a substantially greater amount of lithium in its crystal structure,\nwith a maximum of nearly four lithium atoms per silicon atom\n(Li$_{3.75}$Si), and a specific capacity of 3,600 mAh g$^{-1}$. However,\nwith this ability to eat such large amounts of lithium, silicon gets\nbloated. The periodic volumetric expansion of the anode upon charging\nand discharging (up to 320% expansion) imposes significant mechanical\nstrains on the structure of the device. The silicon must be made into\nnanowires or nanoparticles in order to accommodate the volumetric\nexpansion without cracking, but changing the form factor of the silicon\nis not without its own challenges, as the \"breathing\" of these particles\nstill have the potential to disrupt the interior structure of the cell.\nAttempts to mitigate the volumetric expansion have included the use of\ncarbon containing binders between silicon nanoparticles to increase the\nmechanical stability, however cracking still occurs. Conductive polymers\nincorporated into gels which absorb the mechanical work energy\nassociated with lithiation of silicon have recently shown some success.\nThese polymeric and gel-like binders must obviously be conductive to\nlithium ions. This requirement imposes some additional constraints on\nwhat materials can be used. Despite these challenges, silicon anodes are\nhighly desirable, and an effective strategy is to split the difference\nbetween stability and charge capacity, and to use a mixture of graphite\nand silicon.\n\n#### Alternative cathode materials\n\nIn a lithium-ion battery, the anode and cathode have a similar function:\nto store lithium atoms (Li$^0$) or ions (Li$^{+}$), respectively. Such\nmaterials permit these lithium species to **intercalate** within their\ncrystal structures. The most well known intercalation compound for use\nas the cathode is lithium cobalt oxide. Compared to alternatives\nincluding lithium nickel oxide and nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxides,\nLiCoO$_2$ has a lower capacity for lithium ions, but is more stable at\nhigh-temperature operation. Unfortunately, it is still susceptible to\nrunaway oxidation of the electrolyte, which is highly exothermic, and\ncan lead to fires. Additionally, cobalt is known as a **conflict\nmineral**. Its extraction---much of which is performed in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo---is associated with resource conflict and\nenvironmental degradation. Moreover, some mining organizations have been\nfound to be in abuse of child labor. Alternative cathode materials are\nthus under intense investigation; the target being structures made from\nelements with greater natural abundance (e.g., manganese) and which are\nless susceptible to runaway oxidation and fires.\n\n#### Metal ions\n\nLithium has many advantages as a repository of electrons and for its\nability to intercalate into graphite, silicon, and intercalation\ncompounds used at the cathode. However, lithium is relatively rare\ncompared to other alkali metals, and ancillary metals used in lithium\nion batteries---primarily copper, cobalt, and nickel---suffer from high\ncost, scarcity, and other **negative externalities** of production.\nSodium-ion batteries operate on the same principle as their\nlithium-based counterparts, but with the advantage that sodium is\nubiquitous. Consider that the ocean---a staggeringly huge amount of\nliquid---is more than 1% sodium ions, by mass! One can immediately see\nwhy this small-continent amount of sodium would be so attractive for use\nin batteries.\n\nNevertheless, sodium is much larger than lithium, and thus it is more\ndifficult to achieve high energy densities with sodium than it is with\nlithium.[^11.3.8] The difference in size between sodium and lithium require\nthe use of different electrode materials. For example, instead of\ngraphite, the anode for sodium ion batteries often uses a different\nallotrope of carbon called **hard carbon**, i.e., charcoal. Hard carbon\nis produced by heating certain types of polymers, including **lignin**,\ncarbohydrates, and other precursors in the absence of oxygen at around\n1000 $^{\\circ}$ C. What results is a highly porous, amorphous material\nthat differentiates itself from other carbonaceous allotropes in that it\ncannot be converted to graphite.[^11.3.9] Hard carbon is capable of\nincorporating sodium ions into its structure. Transfer of sodium in and\nout of the solid is made easier by the fact that hard carbon is highly\nporous.\n\nAs in lithium-ion batteries, cathodic materials for their sodium-based\nalternatives also take the form of intercalation compounds. One of the\napparent advantages of sodium-ion technology is that the cathode\nmaterials have the potential to use metals other than cobalt or nickel.\nFor example, sodium metal oxides in which the metal is either iron or\nmanganese---highly earth-abundant compared to cobalt and nickel---have\ncapacities comparable to those of common cathodes used in lithium-ion\nbatteries.\n\n[^11.3.1]: At the time of this writing, a major breakthrough was achieved in\n    the production of energy by fusion. However, most experts agree that\n    it will take quite a long time for such methods of energy production\n    to become widespread.\n\n[^11.3.2]: A fuel cell takes in a chemical fuel, e.g., hydrogen, and outputs\n    electricity and water vapor.\n\n[^11.3.3]: This naming convention between oxidation and reduction, frankly,\n    always annoyed me. The physical particle changing hands is an\n    electron, which has mass, so why would a species be \"reduced\" in any\n    way by accepting additional mass? The reason is that humans probably\n    didn't know that the negative charge was the one that actually had\n    physical mass, i.e., the electron, and that the positive charge was\n    simply the absence of this electron. \"Reduction\" comes from the fact\n    that the charge gets reduced from positive to less positive (or more\n    negative). \"Oxidation\" comes from the fact that when atoms get\n    oxygen atoms attached to them, the highly electronegative oxygen\n    atoms draw electron density away and thus the atoms to which the\n    oxygens are attached become more positive.\n\n[^11.3.4]: If you want, you can use the mnemonic \"Annie the ox\" and \"Cathy\n    the red cat.\"\n\n[^11.3.5]: I tend to think of the \"t\" in *cathode* as a positive sign, and\n    thus I remember which is which. Keep in mind however that in a solar\n    cell, the positive charges come out at the anode. The best way to\n    reconcile this apparent contradiction is that the anode is always\n    the electrode where *conventional*---i.e., positive---current enters\n    the device *most easily*. Consider large forward biases where the\n    current gets really high at positive voltages. In a solar cell, this\n    is positive current entering the anode. If you don't want to think\n    about any of this stuff, just memorize them separately: in a\n    battery, anode is negative; in a solar cell, it is positive. Sorry!\n\n[^11.3.6]: The unusual unit of kilowatt-hours means that there is enough\n    potential energy in the battery to run 100 kW worth of electrical\n    load for 1 h. Granted, the battery may not be able to discharge that\n    fast, but that's the energy capacity assuming you could. It could\n    also power 1 kW worth of electrical load over 100 h. However you\n    want to think about it. That is equivalent to running a hair dryer\n    or toaster oven for 4 days straight.\n\n[^11.3.7]: For some reason, small batteries are rated in terms of current\n    $\\times$ time. The value of 0.01 kWh is derived from a 2 ampere-hour\n    (2000 mAh) battery discharging at a potential difference of 5 V.\n\n[^11.3.8]: Note that whether the atom is lithium or sodium otherwise makes no\n    difference: both have a single ionizable electron and can be\n    oxidized only one time.\n\n[^11.3.9]: A different range of precursors, including fossilized coal or oil,\n    is heated in the absence of oxygen to generate **soft carbon**, or\n    *coke*, which can be further converted to graphite.\n",
