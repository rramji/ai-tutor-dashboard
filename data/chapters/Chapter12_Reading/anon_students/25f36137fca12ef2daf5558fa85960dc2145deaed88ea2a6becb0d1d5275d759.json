      "content": "#### Section 1: Nanofabrication: Mastering and replication\nA logic circuit in a silicon integrated circuit (i.e., a\n*microprocessor* or more generally a *microchip*) contains billions of\n**transistors** (essentially tiny electrical switches). Groups of\ntransistors can be configured to perform complex calculations, and\ngroups of groups of groups (and so on) of transistors are responsible\nfor all of modern computation, the internet, wireless communication, and\nartificially intelligent systems. All of this work is enabled by\nprocesses known as **top-down micro- and nanofabrication**. These\nprocesses use energetic beams of light and electrons to make patterns on\nsurfaces. These patterns are used to guide the deposition of atoms onto\nor into the surface of semiconductor wafers (e.g., silicon) into\nintricate patterns. These wafers are then diced up into microchips and\nintegrated into printed circuit boards, which together execute all the\noperations of a computer. This chapter provides an introduction to\nprocesses used in the semiconductor industry and in university\ncleanrooms. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/Bee9q6GLWSc)\n\nEssentially every active component of your computer and smartphone---not\nto mention the integrated circuits in your car, dishwasher, and\nmicrowave---are made using manufacturing processes that fit under the\numbrella term of **microfabrication**. However, the components of these\nintegrated circuits (e.g., transistors, capacitors, and resistors) of\nmost of these devices have nanoscale dimensions, and thus it is more\nappropriate to refer to the process as **nanofabrication**, and that is\nthe word we will use throughout the rest of this book. Nanofabrication\nis a suite of tools for the manufacturing of nanostructures. It includes\ntools for modifying or decorating materials, such as thin-film\ndeposition, etching, and ion implantation. However, simple modification\nof materials is not enough. These modifications must be patterned in two\nand three dimensions.[^12.1.1] Methods for doing so include techniques of\n**mastering**---generating new patterns for the first time in a form\nfrom which multiple copies can be made---and **replication**---the\nprocesses for making these copies. We will explore these methods, in\nturn, below.\n\n### 12.1.1. Mastering\n\nIn digital technology, you may have heard the word \"mastering\" in\nseveral familiar contexts. For example, remastering a classic movie or\nalbum, or producing a master for a musical recording. What is being\nreferred to is the process of making a high resolution digital\nrepresentation of the content in a form from which it can be copied\nmultiple times, see Figure (12.1). A good example from analog technology\nwhich dates back hundreds of years is the rubber stamp. Once inked, the\nstamp can make many copies of an image before it eventually degrades. In\nthe case of technology from the last few decades, CDs, DVDs, and blu-ray\ndisks are a good example. Here, a master is made by **electron-beam\nlithography**. This master contains raised structures called **relief\nstructures** which is pressed into hot plastic (polycarbonate, for CDs)\nto create an **inverse replica** in the copy. This copy is then\nmetallized by **physical vapor deposition** of aluminum.\n\n(Figure 12.1) \n>>>image(mastering.png.0)\n\nThe manufacturing of silicon microprocessors uses a similar concept,\nexcept that many---up to fifty!---masters are used. In the case of\nsemiconductor manufacturing, the workhorse process of mastering is\ncalled **electron-beam lithography (EBL)**. In EBL, a quartz disc\ncovered with a thin layer of chromium is coated with a thin layer of\nlight-sensitive polymer called an **electron-beam resist**.[^12.1.2] An\nelectron beam is used to draw patterns of lines and shapes into the\nresist film. The film is then immersed in a **developer** solution,\nwhich washes away the regions of the resist film that were either\nexposed or unexposed to the electron beam. Then, the bare chromium in\nthe regions uncovered by the resist film are etched in an etchant\nsolution. This process reveals see-through regions in the pattern\ndefined by the electron beam. The substrate is then placed in a third\ntype of chemical bath, which removes the resist film everywhere else.\nNow what we have is a **transparency mask**---a quartz film covered in\nan opaque chromium film that has patterns defined by EBL.\n\n### 12.1.2. Replication\n\nIt may seem tempting to use EBL as a tool for manufacturing. However,\nthere are two problems.\n\n1.  It is slow\n\n2.  The resolution is not good enough\n\nFor example, it may take several hours to produce a mask for one layer\nof a microprocessor. Also, the patterns written into masks used in\nsemiconductor manufacturing are typically significantly larger than what\nends up in the final chip.[^12.1.3] It is just easier to produce and repair\nlarger masters.\n\nSo, instead of using EBL for replication---i.e., large-scale\nmanufacturing---a different process is used, called **photolithography**\n(Figure (12.2)). Photolithography, meaning roughly \"writing in stone\nwith light,\" is the basis of semiconductor manufacturing and arguably\nthe most sophisticated manufacturing process for any commercial product.\nIt produces hundreds or thousands of patterns per hour with error rates\non the order of one in a quadrillion. Conceptually, it is similar to the\nprocesses that happen in a photographic development, i.e., in a\ndarkroom, except that the film negative (the \"master\\\" in that case) is\nreplaced with the chromium mask produced by EBL. In photolithography, a\nsilicon wafer is coated with a photoresist and placed in a device called\nan **exposure tool** or **stepper**. In this device, high energy light\n(UV) is shone through the mask and focused down (reduced in area) using\na series of lenses onto the photoresist film. The resist film is\ndeveloped, leaving holes, though which materials can be deposited (i.e.,\nions or metals) or the underlying silicon substrate can be etched.\n\n(Figure 12.2) \n>>>image(photolithography.png.0)\n\nPhotolithographic steppers are the keystone instruments used in\nsemiconductor manufacturing. The importance is reflected in their cost,\nwith a state of the art stepper running in the ballpark of \\$10$^8$. It\ntakes several steps of photolithography to generate a pattern in a\nmicroprocessor. For example, the first few steps might be used on the\nbare silicon substrate to define the positions of the transistors.\nSubsequent steps might be used to connect these transistors to one\nanother to generate **logic circuits**. Different areas on the same chip\nwill be responsible for different functions. When it is all said and\ndone, up to fifty layers may have been deposited.\n\n[^12.1.1]: Have you ever seen microscope images of microprocessors that look\n    like futuristic cities?\n\n[^12.1.2]: See Chapter 6 for a discussion of positive-tone and negative-tone\n    photoresists, which are similar to electron-beam resists.\n\n[^12.1.3]: If you break open an integrated circuit and look at the\n    microprocessor inside, it is really, really small.\n",
