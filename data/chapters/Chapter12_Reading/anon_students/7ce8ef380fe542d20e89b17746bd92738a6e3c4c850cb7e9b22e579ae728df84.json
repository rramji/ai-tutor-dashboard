For example, remastering a classic movie or\nalbum, or producing a master for a musical recording. What is being\nreferred to is the process of making a high resolution digital\nrepresentation of the content in a form from which it can be copied\nmultiple times, see Figure (12.1). A good example from analog technology\nwhich dates back hundreds of years is the rubber stamp. Once inked, the\nstamp can make many copies of an image before it eventually degrades. In\nthe case of technology from the last few decades, CDs, DVDs, and blu-ray\ndisks are a good example. Here, a master is made by **electron-beam\nlithography**. This master contains raised structures called **relief\nstructures** which is pressed into hot plastic (polycarbonate, for CDs)\nto create an **inverse replica** in the copy. This copy is then\nmetallized by **physical vapor deposition** of aluminum.\n\n(Figure 12.1) \n>>>image(mastering.png.0)\n\nThe manufacturing of silicon microprocessors uses a similar concept,\nexcept that many---up to fifty!---masters are used. In the case of\nsemiconductor manufacturing, the workhorse process of mastering is\ncalled **electron-beam lithography (EBL)**. In EBL, a quartz disc\ncovered with a thin layer of chromium is coated with a thin layer of\nlight-sensitive polymer called an **electron-beam resist**.[^12.1.2] An\nelectron beam is used to draw patterns of lines and shapes into the\nresist film. The film is then immersed in a **developer** solution,\nwhich washes away the regions of the resist film that were either\nexposed or unexposed to the electron beam. Then, the bare chromium in\nthe regions uncovered by the resist film are etched in an etchant\nsolution. This process reveals see-through regions in the pattern\ndefined by the electron beam. The substrate is then placed in a third\ntype of chemical bath, which removes the resist film everywhere else.\nNow what we have is a **transparency mask**---a quartz film covered in\nan opaque chromium film that has patterns defined by EBL.\n\n### 12.1.2.

The resolution is not good enough\n\nFor example, it may take several hours to produce a mask for one layer\nof a microprocessor. Also, the patterns written into masks used in\nsemiconductor manufacturing are typically significantly larger than what\nends up in the final chip.[^12.1.3] It is just easier to produce and repair\nlarger masters.\n\nSo, instead of using EBL for replication---i.e., large-scale\nmanufacturing---a different process is used, called **photolithography**\n(Figure (12.2)). Photolithography, meaning roughly \"writing in stone\nwith light,\" is the basis of semiconductor manufacturing and arguably\nthe most sophisticated manufacturing process for any commercial product.\nIt produces hundreds or thousands of patterns per hour with error rates\non the order of one in a quadrillion. Conceptually, it is similar to the\nprocesses that happen in a photographic development, i.e., in a\ndarkroom, except that the film negative (the \"master\\\" in that case) is\nreplaced with the chromium mask produced by EBL.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Thin-Film Deposition\nNanofabrication---and microfabrication before it---is intimately tied to\ntechnologies used to deposit thin films. A thin film is generally\nconsidered to be a uniform sheet of material with a thickness of 1$\\mu$m\nor less, though most are less than 100 nm. A thin film can be polymeric,\nmetallic, or ceramic, or particulate (e.g., a thin film of quantum\ndots). Such films are either patterned using a scanning beam directly\n(e.g., photoresist or electron-beam resist---often the same polymers can\nbe used for either purpose), or patterned by lift-off, in which one uses\na stencil mask with openings. The method of depositing the thin film\ndepends on the type of material being deposited and whether or not any\nmaterials already present on the substrate are sensitive to the\nconditions used to deposit the film.\n\n### 12.2.1. Spin coating\n\nSpin coating is a process by which a liquid precursor is deposited on a\nflat substrate. The substrate must be globally planar, but can have\nsmall relief structures that jut out at most a few hundred nanometers\nfrom the plane of the surface. In semiconductor manufacturing, the\nsubstrate is a **silicon wafer** with a diameter up to 18 inches or\nmore. In research on solar cells, the substrate is often a glass slide\ncut into squares with sides of 1 inch each. The substrate is placed on a\n**vacuum chuck** which sucks it down without the need for physical\nclamps, which could damage the substrate. The experimenter---or an\nautomated tool---deposits a liquid precursor onto the substrate, such\nthat the liquid covers the substrate completely. The chuck and the\nsubstrate are then spun around anywhere from 500 rpm to 10,000 rpm.\n\nThe liquid precursor is one of two things: a solution or liquid\nprepolymer. If the precursor is a solution, which contains a polymer,\nsmall molecule, or nanoparticles, the solvent evaporates and generates a\nthin film of the solute. Incredibly, the resulting film is the same\nthickness everywhere, except perhaps at the edges. The resulting\nthickness depends on the concentration of the solute, the spin speed,\nand the volatility of the solvent. The more concentrated, the thicker\nthe resulting film will be. The greater the spin speed, the more\nmaterial will be ejected from the substrate and thus the thinner the\nfilm once solidified. The possibly counterintuitive determinant of\nthickness is the volatility of the solvent (see Figure (12.3)). The\nlower the boiling point, the quicker the solvent evaporates and the more\nsolid is left on the substrate. Once the solvent has evaporated, no more\nmaterial can be ejected from the spinning substrate, and the final\nthickness does not change.\n\n(Figure 12.3) \n>>>image(spin-coating.png.0)\n\nIn contrast, if the precursor is a liquid prepolymer, then the film gets\nthinner and thinner as the sample continues to spin. That is, there may\nbe volatile components, but as long as the precursor is liquid, it will\nbe ejected with increased spin time. Greater spin speeds result in\nthinner films. The major advantage of spin-coating is its simplicity and\nthe fact that it can be used for almost any material that can be\nprocessed from a liquid precursor. One major disadvantage of\nspin-coating is the relatively large amount of material that is ejected\nfrom the spinning substrate. This stuff ends up on the interior walls of\nthe spin coater, and is difficult or impossible to recover.\n\nOther methods of depositing solution-processible materials include\n**spray deposition**, **slot-die coating** or **blade coating**---which\nboth operate through the process of **shear deposition**---and **dip\ncoating**, where one attaches a string to a substrate and draws it up\nout of immersion in a solution at a controlled rate.\n\n### 12.2.2. Physical vapor deposition\n\nOne of the most common forms of thin-film deposition is **physical vapor\ndeposition (PVD)** (Figure (12.4)). While PVD techniques involve\nintimidating-looking vacuum chambers that may take up a significant\nchunk of a room, they are ubiquitous and used in such mundane, low-cost\nproducts such as potato chip bags (the aluminum coating used as a\nbarrier layer). There are three major types of PVD: (1) thermal\nevaporation, (2) electron-beam evaporation, and (3) sputter deposition\n(or coating). Each of these techniques deposits material atom by atom or\nmolecule by molecule and have a broad scope of applicable materials.\nHowever, there are significant differences, which are highlighted where\nappropriate.\n\n(Figure 12.4) \n>>>image(PVD.png.0)\n\n#### Thermal evaporation\n\nDeposition by thermal evaporation is the process by which material is\nraised to a high temperature under low pressure---e.g., 10$^{-6}$\ntorr---and redeposited on a substrate. In conventional thermal\nevaporation, a material is heated resistively to white-hot temperatures\nof a few thousand degrees celsius. The substrate is held several\ncentimeters above the evaporation source. This distance is smaller than\nthe **mean free path** of the evaporated flux of atoms at the base (low)\npressure. This setup ensures that evaporated atoms rarely collide with\nambient gas atoms, which would set them off course. The straight-line\ntrajectory of the evaporated atoms ensures that the thin films are\ndeposited in a **line-of-sight** manner. Thus, a **collimated**\n(straight) beam deposits material like a flashlight, and creates shadows\nwhere no material is deposited. Rotating the substrate in the chamber\ncan produce films with greater uniformity. At atmospheric pressure, the\nmean free path of a gas molecule is about 70 nm. At 10$^{-7}$ torr, the\nmean free path is greater than one meter---generally larger than the\ndimensions of a PVD chamber.\n\n#### Electron-beam evaporation\n\nA related technique to thermal evaporation is **electron-beam thermal\nevaporation** or just **electron-beam evaporation** or just **e-beam\nevaporation**. This technique is similar to conventional thermal\nevaporation except that instead of being heated resistively---i.e., by\nsending a large current at a high voltage through a metal boat\ncontaining the sample to be evaporated---a high energy beam of electrons\nis emitted from a tungsten filament toward the evaporant held in a\ngraphite **crucible**, which is chilled by a recirculating water-based\nchiller. This electron beam again causes the metal to heat up to (even\nhotter!) white-hot temperatures. In e-beam evaporation, much higher\nevaporation rates are possible (tens of nm per second or higher). The\nsystem directs so much energy to the evaporant that a virtual source\nforms a few centimeters from the real source, which is the source from\nwhich the angles for line-of-sight deposition must be calculated. While\ne-beam evaporation causes the evaporant sample to get hotter, faster,\nand is amenable to a range of inorganic materials, it is incompatible\nwith structures that decompose upon exposure to cathode rays, such as\norganic materials. For example, in the production of OLED displays,\nconventional thermal evaporation is used, and the pixels are defined by\nusing a stencil mask.\n\n#### Sputter deposition\n\nThe final category of physical vapor deposition is **sputter\ndeposition**. In this technique, a thick, circular (i.e., a short\ncylindrical) puck or **target** is placed in a device called a sputter\ngun. This apparatus is found in a vaccuum chamber, which is evacuated\nand backfilled with a small amount of an inert gas, such as argon. The\nsputter gun generates radio frequency radiation that ionizes the ambient\ngas. These ions of this **plasma** collide with the metallic or ceramic\nsputter target. The collisions between the ions and the sputter target\neject atoms from the target, which are accelerated toward the substrate.\nMultiple guns can be placed in the chamber and activated simultaneously\nto generate alloys and composite structures. In contrast to thermal and\ne-beam evaporation, sputter deposition works even with relatively high\npressures (though still much lower than atmospheric pressure). This\nincreased pressure reduces the mean free path of sputtered atoms and can\nreduce collimation. Thus, it is possible to achieve greater\nconformability of the deposited films. Sputter deposition is the method\nof choice for coating samples for **scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM)**. It is also used widely in manufacturing of highly mundane\nproducts, such as the aluminum foil coating in potato chip bags.\n\n#### Structure of PVD-deposited thin films\n\nThe morphologies of PVD-deposited thin films differ markedly from those\nof single crystalline or polycrystalline samples. For example, it is not\nuncommon to observe a columnar morphology in a PVD-deposited film, where\nthe crystallites are stacked like columns of coins perpendicular to the\nplane of the film. Another characteristic of PVD-deposited films is the\nsmall size of the grains (i.e., crystallites) and the high density of\ndislocations within them. This arrangement has a profound effect on the\nmechanical behavior of thin films, see Figure (12.5).\n\n(Figure 12.5) \n>>>image(dislocation.png.0)\n\nSince plastic flow, responsible for the metallic properties ductility\nand malleability, depends on the mobility of dislocations, any\nmicroscopic mechanism that impedes the movement of dislocations would\nalso tend to resist deformation of the bulk material. Two of the ways in\nwhich the mobility of dislocations is decreased is\n\n1.  The density of dislocations---i.e., the energetic barrier for a\n    dislocation to move in a zone that already has a lot of them is\n    increased.\n\n2.  The size of the grains and thus the number of grain\n    boundaries---i.e., it is difficult for a dislocation to cross a\n    grain boundary.\n\nThus, both characteristics of PVD-deposited films have the effect of\nhindering the flow of dislocations, inhibiting plastic flow, and thus\nhardening and embrittling the material. The same approach has been used\nhistorically in the field of **metalworking**, in which hammered or\ndrawn metal has increased strength compared to the pristine material.\n\n### 12.2.3. Equipment for PVD\n\n#### Vacuum chambers\n\nMost PVD operations must be carried out in a vacuum chamber capable of\nmaintaining pressures of \\<10$^{-6}$ torr. Critically, every component\nmust be sealed with the appropriate gaskets, and electrical connections\nmust be soldered or passed through with the appropriate hardware.\nReplacement of valves, pumps, and removal of viewing portals or other\ncomponents generally requires a new copper gasket or Viton o-ring every\ntime it is performed. Chilled water is often used in thermal and e-beam\nevaporators to prevent the hearth from overheating and possibly melting.\nNeedless to say, the inlet and outlet lines must be tightened\nappropriately.[^12.2.1] Typically, water lines and chamber doors use\nelastomeric o-rings and circular portals and joints use copper gaskets.\n\n#### High vacuum pumps\n\nIf the heart of a PVD system is the hearth where the sample is heated,\nthe lungs are the vacuum equipment. Most high-vacuum systems have two\nfunctions for pumps, and thus two different kinds of pumps: a **roughing\npump** and a **high-vacuum pump**. Figure (12.6) The roughing pump is\nusually a rotary-vane or direct-drive pump which is required because a\nhigh-vacuum pump generally cannot be exposed to atmospheric pressure,\ndue to saturation of the adsorbant or overheating of the components.\nOnce the roughing pump is used to achieve a sufficiently low pressure\n(ca. 10$^{-3}$ torr), you close the valve to the roughing pump and open\nthe valve to the high-vacuum pump (or turns on the high-vacuum pump in\nthe case of diffusion pumps, which are always connected to the roughing\npump). High-vacuum pumps use a few different mechanisms: **oil\ndiffusion**, **cryogenic**, and **turbomolecular**.\n\n(Figure 12.6) \n>>>image(pumps.png.0)\n\nAn oil diffusion pump---or **momentum transfer pump**---uses a heating\nelement to vaporize a high molecular weight oil in a reservoir. The oil\nmolecules travel up a jet-like column housed in an open cylinder with an\narray of baffles arranged from top to bottom, each larger than the\nprevious, like a Christmas tree. The gas molecules are deflected toward\nthe edges of the chamber, which are cooled. As the oil loses energy and\ndrops back down into the reservoir, a high speed jet of oil molecules\ncollides with gas molecules from inside the chamber. They are exhausted\nby the roughing pump. Advantages of diffusion pumps include the fact\nthat they have no moving parts and are relatively robust against\nfailure. However, given the thermal gradient that must be established\nand the high temperatures needed to vaporize the oil, they are quite\ninefficient. Other disadvantages include inadvertant oxidation of heated\noil by exposing it to atmospheric pressure and possible contamination of\nthe interior of the chamber by oil.\n\nA cryogenic pump or cryopump is a cylindrical contraption with a large\nnumber of concentric circular plates. These plates are covered with a\nmaterial with a high specific surface area such as a zeolite, which\ncontains nanoscale pores that trap gases by van der Waals forces. When\ncooled with liquid helium, a cryopump is capable of adsorbing even the\nlowest molecular weight species, including oxygen and nitrogen gases.\nThe capacity of a cryopump is very low as---unlike a diffusion or\nturbomolecular pump---there is no outlet. Therefore, a cryopump will\nbecome saturated nearly instantly after being exposed to atmospheric\npressure.[^12.2.2] In any case, it needs to be **regenerated** every several\ndays even with normal use. Regeneration involves allowing the pump to\nwarm to ambient temperature and flowing an inert gas through the pump to\ndislodge adsorbed species. The cryopump is then pumped on with the\nroughing pump for several hours. After this procedure, the cryopump is\nisolated and the liquid helium is recirculated through the system.\n\nA turbomolecular pump---or turbopump---is like a miniature jet engine.\nIt contains many layers of fans or **stages** that spin up to 90 krpm.\nThese fans knock gas molecules from one stage to the next until they\nexit through the exhaust out the rear. In this type of pumping, a\nbacking pump is required to reduce the mean free path of molecules to be\nshorter than the distance between stages.\n\n[^12.2.1]: One time in grad school, I was charged with sandblasting the\n    components of our e-beam evaporator. After I reassembled the\n    chamber, I neglected to reconnect the water lines to the hearths.\n    Upon opening the chamber after checking to see if it would hold a\n    vacuum, 5 inches of water flooded from the chamber onto the floor,\n    in close proximity of many high voltage lines connecting the\n    equipment. I never told my professor.\n\n[^12.2.2]: I have done this accidentally many times.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Patterning techniques\nTaken together, the techniques of mastering and replication using\nelectron-beam lithography, photolithography, and thin-film deposition\nform the basis of semiconductor manufacturing in industry and\nnanofabrication in research laboratories. It may still not be clear\nhowever how these technologies actually yield patterned structures on\nsilicon (or other) wafers. Once a pattern in a photoresist film is in\nplace, various approaches can be used to convert this pattern into a\ncircuit or circuit component. All of these approaches involve using the\nresist film as a stencil mask, see Figure (12.7).\n\n(Figure 12.7) \n>>>image(substrate modification.png.0)\n\n### 12.3.1. The resist film as a stencil mask\n\nThe openings in a resist film generated by electron beam or\nphotolithography can be used to deposit or remove material from the\nunderlying substrate. These processes include lift-off (basically like\nspray painting through a stencil and then \"lifting off\" the stencil),\nion implantation (sort of like lift-off, except that the \"spray paint\"\npenetrates into the substrate), and etching, where some of the\nunderlying substrate is removed in a pattern defined by the stencil\nmask.\n\n#### Lift-off\n\nIn a **lift-off** process, a thin film (often PVD-deposited) is\nevaporated across the entire substrate. Dissolution of the resist film\nreleases the evaporated film everywhere except where the evaporated film\nmade direct contact with the substrate. Sometimes, an **adhesion\npromoter**---such as chromium or titanium---must be used for certain\nmetals---such as gold, silver, palladium, or platinum---to stick to\nsilicon well enough to survive the lift-off process. For the lift-off\nprocess to work, the solvent must be able to get to the resist film, and\nthus a PVD-deposited overlayer which is to be patterned that is too\nthick will impede the process. Often, bath sonication is used to\ngenerate enough cracks in the overlayer for the solvent to undercut. If\nthe resist film is insoluble (as often occurs with negative-tone\nphotoresist), an underlying resist film called a **lift-off resist** is\nused below the thicker resist, whose primary purpose is to protect the\nsubstrate.\n\n#### Ion implantation\n\nMetal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) typically\nrequire one or more steps of **ion implantation** to **dope** the source\nand drain regions of the device. The process of ion implantation is\nsimilar to that of electron beam evaporation, except that it is the ions\nthemselves which undergo thermionic emission from a heated filament.\nIons are accelerated with energies on the order of of 100-1000 keV. The\nenergy affects the depth of implantation, which can range from a few\nnanometers to a few microns. To reiterate the effect of the process of\n**doping**, atoms with fewer valencies than silicon (e.g., boron),\np-dope the semiconductor, while those with more valencies than silicon\n(e.g., phosphorous and arsenic) n-dope the semiconductor. Both types of\ndoping lead to an increase in the overall conductivity and also\ninfluence the formation of depletion layers at p-n junctions in, e.g.,\nsolar cells.\n\n#### Etching\n\nA third category of modification of the substrate whose pattern can be\ndictated by photolithography is **etching**. Whereas deposition of a\nthin film by PVD is **additive**, etching is the removal of material in\na **subtractive** process. Etching can be accomplished under either wet\nconditions---**wet etch**---or dry conditions---**dry etch**. Wet\netching typically uses some reactive compound dissolved in a solvent.\nFor example, a typical **etchant** for silicon is potassium hydroxide\n(KOH), and a typical etchant for silica---i.e., silicon dioxide---is\nhydrofluoric acid (HF). There are recipes for many etchants used for\nmany different metals. Etchants can be as simple as acetic acid for zinc\nor may involve multiple components, such as a mixture of KI and I $_{2}$\nfor gold.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 4: Unconventional methods for lithography\nThe best possible resolution of photolithography is limited by the\nwavelength of light used. In the case of visible and near-ultraviolet\nlight, the wavelength is much larger than the size of nanoscale features\none wants to make. For example, if you shine light with a wavelength of\n600 nm through a stencil mask with circular holes of 100 nm diameter\nseparated by 100 nm, your image will be a big blur. The mask will block\nsome of the intensity of the light, but you will get no image. All of\nthe light waves will diffract as they exit the 100 nm openings in the\nstencil and interfere with each other. One of the ways of getting around\nthis conundrum---which we have already touched on in the context of\nimaging---is to not use photons of light. Instead, particles capable of\ntraveling with a smaller wavelength than light are capable of higher\nresolution. Such methods, which use beams of charged particles like\nelectrons or ions, are used widely in the manufacturing of\nsemiconductors. For example, electron-beam lithography is the method of\nchoice for producing masks for photolithography (i.e., mastering).\nAnother widely used tool is **focused-ion beam (FIB) lithography**. In\nFIB lithography, a beam of ions is used to bombard a sample and etch\nlittle bits of it away, like an atomic-scale jackhammer. Alternatively,\nthe method can be configured to deposit material. In semiconductor\nmanufacturing, this capability is often used to repair the masks---i.e.,\nmasters---used in photolithography. In the rest of this chapter, we will\nfocus on a different type of non-photolithographic processing that uses\nnot beams of photons or charged particles, but physical contact (Figure\n(12.8)).\n\n(Figure 12.8) \n>>>image(unconventional nanofabrication.png.0)\n\n### 12.4.1. Contact lithography\n\nTo get around the effects of diffraction, researchers have been\ninterested in alternative methods of lithography that do not require\nlight. Often, these methods involve physical contact of a stamp or a\nstylus with a substrate. Instead of being limited by light, the\nresolution of these methods is determined by intermolecular forces and\nthe inherent \"graininess\" of matter. These approaches are generally not\nused for the fabrication of integrated circuits for computers and mobile\ndevices. However, they are useful in the research laboratory, and also\ncommercially in cases where unusual materials must be patterned---e.g.,\nmicrofluidic reactors for drug encapsulation, biomolecular species for\nnext-generation genetic sequencing, and fabrication of optical storage\nmedia.\n\n#### Lithography using hard stamps\n\nOne of the most common types of unconventional nanofabrication involves\nvarious forms of stamping and molding. These stamps or molds have\n**relief structures**---or 3D topography---just like conventional rubber\nstamps. Such stamps can be made out of either hard or soft materials.\nHard stamps are generally made of quartz, silicon, or glassy polymers.\nThese stamps can be pressed into a photocurable or thermally curable\npolymer.[^12.4.1] Once cured, these polymers take on the inverse relief\nstructure of the stamp. An advantage of transparent stamps like those\nmade of quartz is that light can be transmitted through them to cure\nphotocurable polymers. An example of this type of approach is\nexemplified by **step-and-flash imprint lithography (SFIL)**. Optical\nstorage disks like CDs and DVDs (I know, ancient technologies) are made\nusing a similar process of injection molding of a thermoplastic into a\nmold with submicron relief structures---around 800 nm for CDs and 600 nm\nfor DVDs---patterned initially by electron beam lithography. In fact,\nthis technology has been used since the early 1980s!\n\n#### Soft lithography\n\nWhile manufacturing features on the submicron (almost \"nano\") scale has\nbeen used for commercial products for decades, the use of hard materials\nhas limitations. For example, hard materials can generally only be used\nto pattern super flat surfaces. That is, the features cannot conform to\nmicro- or nanoscale roughness, nor can they bend globally to pattern,\ne.g., cylindical, spherical, or bent substrates. Additionally, the\nstiffness of a hard stamp makes it difficult to **demold** or remove\nfrom the hardened object without damaging the stamp or the product.\nFinally, hard stamps are generally made from materials that are\nnonporous, and cannot hold onto liquids like a reservoir to make\nmultiple \"prints\" from a single inking.\n\nThe most common polymers used for soft lithography are silicone\nelastomers, such as **poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)** or just **silicone\nrubber**. PDMS has the repeating structure of \\[--O--Si(CH$_3$)$_2$--\\].\nUnlike most common polymers, the backbone of PDMS does not contain\ncarbon atoms.[^12.4.2] PDMS can be hardened by crosslinking; the crosslinking\nreaction can be performed using light, heat, or simply exposure to air.\nA common form of PDMS is the silicone caulking used to seal bathtubs.\nUnlike caulking, which is a single-component liquid **prepolymer**, the\nPDMS most often used in laboratories has two parts: **base** and\n**crosslinker**. The reaction involves a **hydrosilylation** reaction\nand is activated at moderate heating of 60-80 $^{\\circ}$ C. The most\nfamous type of PDMS is called Sylgard-184, produced commercially by Dow\nCorning, which uses a ratio of base:crosslinker of 10:1. Once\ncured---i.e., crosslinked---Sylgard-184 has an elastic modulus of \u00a01 MPa\nand a hydrophobic surface. It is also sticky due to **viscoelastic\nadhesion**[^12.4.3] and is optically transparent. All of these properties\nmake it useful for a number of applications in nanofabrication.\n\n#### Aside about polymers in manufacturing\n\nMolding and embossing play a special role in nanofabrication. Almost\nevery plastic object you use every day is molded. There are three types\nof polymers that can be molded:\n\n1.  Thermoplastics\n\n2.  Thermosetting polymers\n\n3.  Photopolymers\n\nA **thermoplastic** is a meltable plastic that is poured or injected\nwhile hot into a mold. Once cooled, the solid piece is removed from the\nmold. A thermosetting polymer or **thermoset** is liquid at room\ntemperature and poured into a mold. The mold and prepolymer are then\nheated. Heating initiates a crosslinking reaction that hardens the\npolymer into a solid. A cool thing about thermosets is that they can't\nbe re-melted. Instead, at high enough temperatures, they burn. A\n**photopolymer** is similar to a thermoset except that instead of heat,\nlight is used to activate the crosslinking reaction which hardens the\npolymer. To let the light in, a mold used must either be transparent all\naround or open on top. A good example of the photocrosslinking process\nis in dental fillings. First, the dentist applies a paste to the surface\nof the tooth needing to be filled. Then, they take a lamp with a\n**waveguide**---i.e., a transparent conduit for light---and shine it at\nthe paste. After a few seconds, the polymer becomes about as hard and as\ndurable as the rest of your teeth!\n\n#### Replica molding\n\nWith that introduction to thermoplastics, thermosets, and photopolymers\nout of the way, we can see how they are used in nanofabrication. The\nsimplest thing you can do with a stamp is to use it to mold liquid\nprepolymers. Usually, this stamp is made of PDMS. The use of this stamp\nto mold other polymers from liquid precursors is known as **replica\nmolding**. Replica molding is the use of a patterned stamp---which can\nbe hard or soft---to transfer patterns into a liquid prepolymer, which\nis then hardened by thermoplastic, thermosetting, or photosetting\nmechanisms.\n\nThe resolution of replica molding can be very good: on par with that of\nphotolithography. For example, the smallest feature sizes ever\nreplicated is a single 0.4 nm step edge attributed to the diameter of a\nsilicon atom. Thus, replicating objects of molecular dimensions, such as\nproteins, viruses, and carbon nanotubes is relatively straightforward.\nHowever, the practical resolution for determining patterns of the type\nneeded to make structures like those found in integrated circuits is not\nlimited to physics or mechanics, but rather by the technique used to\nmake the stamp. That is, the technique used for mastering.\n\nStamps used in replica molding are mastered using either electron-beam\nlithography or photolithography. In university settings and R&D labs,\nthe best resolution is achieved by e-beam lithography. With either\ntechnique, it is the height and spacing of the hardened resist features\nafter development that define the pattern for the PDMS prepolymer. This\npolymer is poured on top of the e-beam patterned substrate (master),\nheated, and hardened (i.e., as a thermoset), and then used to create\nreplicas in other polymers, such as epoxies, acrylates, polycarbonates,\nconductive polymers, or even other silicone rubber materials. Note that\nthe final structure has the same **polarity** as the original master\ncreated by e-beam lithography.[^12.4.4] The PDMS stamp, on the other hand,\nhas the reverse polarity, because its role is to transfer the pattern\nfrom the master to the replica. The process makes good, efficient use of\nmaterials because one master can produce many stamps, and every stamp\ncan produce many replicas.\n\nIn the early days of molding, it was thought that it could be used to\nreplace or complement photolithography in many applications in\nmicroelectronics manufacturing. In these cases, hard stamps were used to\navoid deformation of the pattern when used over large (100 cm$^2$)\nareas. There are two variants of the process, **nanoimprint\nlithography**, which uses heat to cure the polymer and can thus use an\nopaque master like etched silicon as the stamp, and **step-and-flash\nimprint lithography**, which uses light to harden the replica. In this\nprocess, a transparent stamp like quartz must be used.\n\nNanoimprint and step-and-flash processes never took off as a replacement\nfor photolithography in commercial production. The reasons include the\ndifficulty and expense of registering a physical stamp with preexisting\nnanostructures, breakage of and build up of crud on the the microscopic\nrelief features of the stamp, and the inability of a stamp to squeeze\nthe liquid precursor out of the spaces between features.[^12.4.5]\n\n#### Microcontact printing\n\nThe second major way in which stamps can be used for replicating\nnanostructures is by printing physical inks---**microcontact printing**.\nThese inks can be prepolymers, solutions of small molecules or\nbiomolecules, or precursors to self-assembled monolayers. Unlike molding\ntechniques, which work with either hard or soft stamps, microcontact\nprinting works best with soft ones. The reason is that soft stamp\nmaterials like PDMS are porous on the molecular scale and can be used as\nreservoirs for liquids. This way, the stamp can be inked once to\ngenerate several prints.\n\nBy far, the most successful demonstrations of microcontact printing\ninvolve the printing of molecular monolayers of either alkoxysilanes on\nsilicon or alkane thiols on noble metals like gold and silver. The\nlateral resolution is thought to be limited by spreading of the\nelastomeric features in contact with the substrate and also by diffusion\nof vapors into regions of the substrate around the perimeter of contact\nwith the stamp. If features are too close to one another, they will tend\nto bleed together.\n\nPatterning of molecular monolayers can be used for a few major purposes.\nThe first is to use the monolayers as etch resists to make small\npatterns of metal, but this approach is used less frequently than\nconventional photolithography followed by lift-off. However, a major way\nin which microcontact printing is used not only in the research\nlaboratory but also commercially is in biotechnology. For example, to\nprint nucleic acids and proteins directly, or to print molecules used as\nbinding sites for these molecules. This technique is used widely in the\nsequencing of genetic information, as large libraries of nucleic acids\ncan be deposited on wafers or chips in precise locations. Binding of\ncomplementary DNA bases can be visualized using a variety of techniques\nto reconstruct the whole genome.[^12.4.6]\n\n### 12.4.2. Writing using scanning probes\n\nIn the field of nanofabrication it is common to take tools used for\nimaging and repurpose them for fabrication. Note that electron beam\nlithography is essentially a scanning electron microscope, except that\nthe beam is not used for imaging, but for writing. Even photolithography\nuses the principles of optical engineering---lenses, reflection,\nprojection, etc.---originally developed for conventional microscopy. It\nturns out that a creative bit of reengineering can be used to transform\nscanning probe microscope tips into something akin to fountain pens and\nengraving tools!\n\n#### Dip-pen nanolithography\n\nJust as a silicone rubber stamp can be inked to transfer patterns of\nliquid precursors, an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip can be used like\na quill pen. The use of an AFM tip for nanofabrication is called\n**dip-pen nanolithography**.[^12.4.7] Inks used have been alkane thiols to\nproduce self-assembled monolayers in precise patterns, along with\nconductive polymers and biomolecules. While a major apparent\ndisadvantage of this technique is that it is serial and therefore slow,\nit can be made parallel by combining many tips into an array.\n\n#### Nanoindentation lithography\n\nIn materials science, a common technique to measure the hardness,\nplasticity, and elastic rebound of materials is **nanoindentation**.\nThis approach uses a hard indenter, typically diamond, and presses it\ninto a sample. The hardness of the material corresponds to the depth of\nindentation at a given force as well as the lateral spread of the\nmaterial when indented. A related technique is progressive load scratch\ntesting, which gives you information about the hardness and plasticity,\nas well as adhesion, of thin coatings on substrates. Usually, the same\ninstrument can be used for either nanoindentation or scratch testing.\n\nBoth nanoindentation and scratch testing leave markings behind on the\nsubstrate after they have made their measurements. As you can imagine,\nresearchers have used patterns of these indentations and scratches as\ntemplates to form nanostructures. For example, for permanent information\nstorage (i.e., dogtags on the nanoscale) and optical metamaterials.\n\n### 12.4.3. Other approaches\n\n#### Drawing\n\nNanostructures can also be made using techniques familiar to the fiber\nand textile industries like drawing, spinning, and extrusion. Drawing is\nthe process of stretching a molten polymer, metal, or glass. Submicron\nfiber diameters can easily be achieved. In fact, if one starts with a\nhollow glass tube, heats it up, then stretches it out, the diameter\nshrinks dramatically but the hollow passageway---the **lumen**---stays\nput! This technique is used widely in the preparation of tips to poke\nsingle cells and get measurements from them. These tips are also used to\ninject or remove genetic material. Drawn glass fibers are also used\nwidely as optical waveguides in research and in fiber optic\ncommunications.[^12.4.8] The production of polymeric fibers can also be\nachieved at the interface between two reacting monomer types.[^12.4.9]\n\n#### Spinning\n\nAnother way in which copious numbers of fibers can be generated is by\n**spinning**. The spinning process resembles the way in which cotton\ncandy is made, in which a liquid precursor is loaded into a spinneret\nand flung around at high speeds inside a chamber. Fibers of various\npolymers can be made this way. For especially thin fibers, a related\nmethod---**electrospinning**---can be used. In electrospinning, a\nmetallic needle (spinneret) is held at a high voltage relative to a\ngrounded carrier substrate, which when stationary generates mats of\ndisorderly fibers, or spun, to generate aligned ones. Nanofibers---or,\nsometimes, nanowires---produced by electrospinning are potentially\nuseful for a variety of purposes, including nanowire transistors,\nbiosensors, and membranes (used for either encapsulation or separation).\n\n#### Extrusion\n\nNanofibers can also be made by pushing molten polymer through a porous\ndie, like how spaghetti is made. The advantage of extruded fibers is\nthat their cross-sections can have any shape, whereas those made by\ndrawing are typically cylindrical. Extruded nanofibers have potential\nuses as platforms for tissue regeneration and drug delivery, among other\napplications.\n\n#### Cutting\n\nIf you start with a hunk of cheese and you are asked to make a smaller\npiece of cheese, you cut a piece off. Similarly, in nanofabrication, it\nis possible to use an **ultramicrotome** to cut objects into thin\nslabs.[^12.4.10] The repurposing of an ultramicrotome to make nanostructures\nis called \"nanoskiving.\"[^12.4.11] It involves the deposition of metal,\npolymers, and ceramics onto a substrate which, when sectioned by the\nultramicrotome, form functional structures. For example, a thin film can\nbe sectioned into long wires. If one sections forests of cylindrical\nnanopillars (e.g., of semiconductors, polymers, or metals) one obtains\narrays of nanodisks. Such structures can be used for a variety of\npurposes, e.g., for optical metamaterials.[^12.4.12]\n\n#### Self-assembly\n\nIn a future world, we wouldn't have to go through the hassle of creating\nmasks, stamps, and the manufacturing infrastructure needed to make\nnanostructures. Instead, we would put all the starting materials in a\npot, stir, and end up with exactly the nanoscale objects we wanted. The\nproof of concept for this seemingly magical approach is the existence of\nbiological organisms. Plants, animals, and other life forms start only\nwith instructions (in the form of genes, some starting materials, and\naccess to the environment) and end up as complex multicellular life\nforms. On the other hand, human-initiated self-assembly has not achieved\nsuch complexity. However, it has nonetheless led to the production of\nmany useful materials and structures, see Figure (12.9).\n\n(Figure 12.9) \n>>>image(self-assembly.png.0)\n\nIn fact, we have seen several of these structures before: for example,\nself-assembled monolayers are used in biotechnology and molecular\nmonolayers of silanes are used in microfabrication. Similarly, the\nstructures formed by block copolymers are found throughout the\nmanufacture of integrated circuits. Vesicles formed from combinations of\namphiphilic molecules and short chains of polymers have been in the news\nas carriers of mRNA-based vaccines. Indeed, while nowhere near the\ncomplexity of biological organisms, modern life has been transformed by\nthese examples of self-assembled nanostructures.\n\n### 12.4.4. 3D printing of nanostructures\n\n#### Subtractive and additive approaches\n\nStandard techniques of nanofabrication, including etching, liftoff, and\nphotolithography using positive-tone photoresists, are known as\n**subtractive** processes. That is, one starts with a solid structure\nand then removes unwanted bits, which are usually discarded. Sculpting\nin marble by carving is a familiar example of a subtractive method. In\ncontrast, sculpting using clay or artists' putty is an **additive**\nprocess. With additive processes, one places material bit by bit---only\nwhere it is needed---to build up the structure.\n\nNowadays, additive processing---or **additive manufacturing**---is\nclosely related to the technique known as **3D printing**. With 3D\nprinting, one inputs a computer-generated design into a tool (a 3D\nprinter), which generates the structure, **voxel by voxel**, in a serial\nprocess.[^12.4.13] The principal advantage of 3D printing compared to\nconventional techniques of molding is that it allows for **rapid\nprototyping** and customizability. The ability to create load-bearing,\nfunctional, 3D structures from computer drawings is very powerful.\nConventional machining and manufacturing techniques take manual\nexpertise, time, and capital. Similarly important as rapidity is\ncustomizability. For example, when 3D printing a part, e.g., for a\nbiomedical implant, one can generate the part from a scan of the\npatient's physiology with which the printed part must match. The primary\ndisadvantage of 3D printing is that it is quite slow (and therefore\nexpensive) to be used for mass production. That is, there are few rapid,\nparallel methods of replication as there are in conventional printing or\nmolding using a stamp.\n\n#### Extrusion based methods\n\nThe first method of 3D printing to achieve widespread adoption is an\nextrusion-based method known as **fused filament fabrication**, also\nknown as **fused deposition modeling**. In this technique, a heated\nprint head with a small (\\<1 mm) aperture moves about a stage,\ndepositing material in predefined locations on a substrate. After one\nlayer is complete, the print head is raised and begins to deposit\nmaterial on the next layer. The process resembles that of bricklaying,\nwhile the extrusion mechanism is a bit like the deposition of hot glue\nfrom a glue gun. Advantages of such extrusion-based approaches to 3D\nprinting include the inexpense of the polymeric materials and the scope\nof polymers (most thermoplastics can be made to work). Also, the\nsimplicity of the mechanical parts make maintenance of such systems\nrelatively easy. Metallic parts can also be fabricated by fused\ndeposition processes.\n\n#### Stereolithography\n\nIn a process resembling the photpolymerization or photocrosslinking of\nnegative-tone photoresist, light can be focused in liquid prepolymer to\ngenerate a solid structure. This technique is called\n**stereolithography** or **SLA**. It is \"stereo\" because light needs to\nbe focused at a particular depth in order to generate enough\nconstructive interference to solidify the polymer. Operationally, the\nSLA process resembles fused filament fabrication. As the beam of focused\nlight is scanned around, an elevator lifts the slowly built piece from\nthe bath of prepolymer. Advantages of the technique are resolution and\nspeed, and the fact that it is amenable to elastomeric materials.\nDisadvantages include the cost of the resins, the fact that they have to\nbe photocurable, and the relative complexity of stereolithography\nprinters and the difficulty of do-it-yourself repairs to these systems,\ncompared to extrusion-based printers, whose components are simpler.\n\n[^12.4.1]: To cure, as in a polymer, means to harden.\n\n[^12.4.2]: It is thus known as an **inorganic polymer**.\n\n[^12.4.3]: The same reason that chewed chewing gum is sticky.\n\n[^12.4.4]: Polarity refers to the directionality of the relief structures.\n    For objects with the same polarity, the raised parts of the master\n    are raised in the replica, and vise versa.\n\n[^12.4.5]: The thin layer of imprint resist that remains is called the **scum\n    layer** that requires an additional step to remove. In fact, when\n    examining molded plastic parts found in every day life, one often\n    sees a seam around the edge formed at the location of the pressing\n    together of two halves of the mold. This layer is analogous to the\n    scum layer, but it is called the **flash layer** and is usually\n    removed by cutting or grinding.\n\n[^12.4.6]: This technique, exemplified by the approach of Illumina, is known\n    as **shotgun sequencing**.\n\n[^12.4.7]: Developed by the laboratory of Professor Chad Mirkin at\n    Northwestern University.\n\n[^12.4.8]: Given the hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber optic cables\n    across and and under the oceans---together comprising millions of\n    miles of individual fibers---it is not a stretch (pun intended) to\n    say that most information exchanged globally is conveyed via drawn\n    optical fibers!\n\n[^12.4.9]: The quintessential method is exemplified in the **nylon rope\n    trick** seen in chemistry courses. Two reacting partners form a\n    solid at an interface between immiscible liquids. As the solid\n    material is drawn out by a hook, more interface between the\n    reactants is exposed and more polymer is generated. The solid\n    material can continue to be drawn onto a spool until one of the\n    reactants is used up.\n\n[^12.4.10]: The ultramicrotome is a mechanical cutting tool originally\n    designed to section thin slices of materials and biological samples\n    for microscopy.\n\n[^12.4.11]: *Skiving* means to slice thin sheets off of something. In British\n    English, it means to slack off.\n\n[^12.4.12]: A disclaimer: nanoskiving was the topic of my PhD research.\n    Despite my personal interests in this technique, it failed to\n    achieve use outside the research laboratory. Thank you for your\n    indulgence about my including it in this book anyway.\n\n[^12.4.13]: In analogy to a 2D pixel in conventional image rendering, a voxel\n    is a 3D pixel, or \"volume pixel.\"\n",

Soft lithography: Employs flexible materials like PDMS for stamping.\n\n3. Microcontact printing: Uses soft stamps to print molecular monolayers.\n\n4. Dip-pen nanolithography: Uses AFM tips like quill pens to write nanopatterns.\n\nWhich specific type would you like to explore further?",
