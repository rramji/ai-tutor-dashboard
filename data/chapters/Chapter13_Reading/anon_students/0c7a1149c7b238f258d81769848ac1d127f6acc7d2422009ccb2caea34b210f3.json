This chapter discusses processes of synthesis and\nself-assembly---i.e., **bottom-up**---of nanoscale materials, along with\nan application which has transformed the delivery of cancer therapeutics\nand vaccines. Namely, nanomedicine. For a video primer to this chapter,\nvisit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/SGomGeqy3U8)\n\nIn order to have nanotechnology, you need to be able to create\nnanostructures. In the previous chapter, we covered some of the most\ncommon ways in which nanostructures are produced from top-down methods.\n\"Top down\" means that, like a marble sculpture, the structure in some\nsense already exists inside a slab of material. All that is needed is to\ncut away the extra material, leaving the desired structure(s).[^13.1.1] The\nprocess is sometimes called **subtractive**, in that the bits that are\ncut away are usually discarded. To describe the process in a less\npejorative light than what is implied by the word *subtractive*,\nphotolithography and electron-beam lithography are also often called\n**deterministic**, meaning that the engineer (or artist) knows where the\nmaterials are going to end up in the final structure. Typical materials\nthat are amenable to top-down nanofabrication include silicon, silicon\ndioxide or quartz, other oxides, and metals. Polymeric films such as\nphotoresists are also patterned by the quintessential top-down method,\nphotolithography. Thus, top-down nanofabrication processes are used in\nsome of the most sophisticated manufacturing schemes ever devised for\ncommercial products (i.e., microchips).\n\nIn contrast to top-down nanofabrication, so-called bottom-up processes\nuse thermodynamics, electrostatics, shape recognition, and other\nnaturally occurring phenomena to determine---as if programmed---where\neverything will end up. In bottom-up processes, smaller, unstructured\ncomponents become converted through minimal external intervention into\nfunctional, higher-order structures. A very simple example might be spin\ncoating a photoresist film. That is, a polymer in solution, which\nconsists of disordered molecules floating around, gets cast into a two\ndimensional solid film. This film has macroscopic dimensions and a\nmorphology whose microscopic structure is determined by the molecular\ndetails of the materials from which it is made. Figure (13.1)\nillustrates the differences between top-down and bottom-up approaches to\nnanofabrication, along with some examples of each.\n\n(Figure 13.1) \n>>>image(top-down bottom-up.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.1. Biological structuresThe quintessential example of\nbottom-up fabrication is the self-assembly of biological structures. One\nprominent example is the three-dimensional shape adopted by protein\nmolecules. Protein structure is remarkable because every chemically\nidentical protein molecule (i.e. made up of the same sequence of amino\nacids) will fold up to form a physically identical structure, whereas\nthe physical structures assumed by conventional polymer chains are\nhighly variable, so that polymer structure is understood as a\nstatistical distribution among many possible chain conformations.\nMoreover, the self-assembly of protein molecules is **hierarchical**,\nwith many smaller self-assembled structures self-assembling to make up\nthe final structure. Examples of these multilevel self-assembled\nstructures are alpha helices, beta sheets, and supramolecular\narrangements where multiple peptide chains form a larger, quaternary\nstructure (see Figure (13.2)). The self-assembly of biomolecules is an\nexample from nature that nanotechnologists use as a proof-of-principle\nand indeed inspiration that a bottom-up process might be used to create\nalmost any complex structure with wide-ranging functionality.\n\n(Figure 13.2) \n>>>image(protein.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.2. Micelles, vesicles, and other amphiphilic structures\nMoreover, protein-based nanostructures---and even RNA-based\nnanostructures in cells---are used in biological systems in the form of\nenzymes and other types of molecular machines.[^13.1.2] Such an incredible\narray of functions further motivate engineers, chemists,\nnanotechnologists, and biotechnologists. In fact, the physical structure\nof the cell itself is a supreme example of bottom-up nanofabrication.\nThe cell membrane is an example of a **bilayer vesicle**, part of a\nfamily that includes micelles and inverted micelles, see Figure (13.3).\nIt forms because the molecules that make it up are **amphiphilic**,\nmeaning that part of the molecule likes water and the other part likes\nnonpolar media. In the case of a bilayer vesicle, the amphiphiles pair\nup such that the hydrophobic tail groups point toward each other to make\nup the \"skin\" of the vesicle. At the same time, the ionic head groups\npoint toward the exterior and interior of the vesicle, where the water\nis. The principles at play are the same as those which determine the\nseparation of oil and water in a bottle of salad dressing.\n\n(Figure 13.3) \n>>>image(bilayer vesicle.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.3. Block copolymers Another form of molecular self-assembly\nwhich we have encountered already is the formation of higher ordered\nnanostructures from block copolymers. For example, a polymer chains\ncomposed of two or more chemically dissimilar blocks can be engineered\nto self-assemble themselves into various shapes. Arrays of cylinders,\nlines, lamellar (layer-cake like) structures, and three-dimensional\narrays of spheres can all be generated. Addditionally, the contiguous\ngyroidal structures that can be formed by block copolymer assemblies in\n3-dimensions are not only aesthetically interesting. Many of these\nstructures are useful in technological applications, such as low\ndielectric layers in telecommunications, graphics processors, and\nprinted circuit boards for low-loss transmission of data.\n\n### 13.1.4. Self-assembly Central to the concept of bottom-up\nnanofabrication is the concept of **self-assembly**. Self-assembly is\nthe process by which simple structures become more complex structures.\nThat is, how lower-order structures like molecules and nanoparticles\ncome together to form higher-ordered structures like micelles, bilayer\nvesicles, molecular monolayers, and the shapes formed by block\ncopolymers, and even proteins, cell membranes, and larger biological\nstructures. The difference between \"self-assembly\" and more familiar\nwords such as \"synthesis\" and \"formation\" is not always clear. However,\nit is generally taken that true self-assembly refers to\nthermodynamically reversible processes, whereas synthesis often involves\nchanges in oxidation states, the formation of covalent bonds, and those\nwhich are difficult to reverse or undo without significant effort.\nHowever, as this chapter is not specifically about self-assembly, but\nrather about fabrication using bottom-up processing techniques, we will\nstart with some relevant aspects of synthesis---i.e., of molecules and\nnanoparticles---which is often the first step in bottom-up processes.\nThat is, making the parts that ultimately go into the final manufactured\nproduct.\n\n[^13.1.1]: I think the idea of using tools to reveal what an artist\n    visualized as already existing within a slab of marble originated\n    with Michelangelo.\n\n[^13.1.2]: Indeed, the ribosome---which translates mRNA molecules into\n    protein molecules---is an incredible example of natural molecular\n    manufacturing!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Synthesis\nThe process of synthesis in principle encompasses everything ever used\nin the field of chemistry to make stuff: drugs, plastics, fuels,\ncoatings, food additives, and so forth. However, we find that once we\nlimit ourselves to the synthesis of higher order structures with\nnanoscale dimensions (dimensions larger than typical molecules), we\nwhittle the list down to only a few of the most common examples. These\ninclude nanoparticles based on metals and semiconductors (**metallic\nnanoparticles** and **quantum dots**), along with those made from\npolymers (including individual polymer chains and sphere-like\n**dendrimers**).\n\n### 13.2.1. Synthesis of zero dimensional metal nanoparticles\n\nSince the development of **electron microscopy** (including scanning\nelectron microscopy, **SEM**, and transmission electron microscopy,\n**TEM**), chemists have been interested in synthesizing metallic\nnanoparticles whose three-dimensional shapes can be readily verified. In\ngeneral, these methods involve the chemical reduction of a metal salt\nwhere the metal comes out of the bottle in oxidized form (e.g., gold\nnanoparticles are made using chloroauric acid, H\\[AuCl$_4$\\], where gold\nhas the oxidation state of 3+). It is typical to add a polymer into the\nmixture to prevent aggregation of the particles during growth and\nthereafter. The polymer prevents aggregation by polymer-mediated steric\nforces, a type of repulsive force of entropic origin covered in Chapter\n3. Very often, one or more types of surfactants or metal ligands are\nused as well.[^13.2.1] Often, a surfactant to afford solubility is used as\nwell. The ligands or surfactants are often amphiphilic molecules such as\nan alkane thiol (RSH) or a trialkylphospine oxide. Such molecules bind\nselectively to certain crystallographic faces of the growing crystalline\nnanoparticle and thus block further growth at that face. The other faces\ngrow in unencumbered. This strategy is used as a means of obtaining\nnanoparticles with specific shapes.[^13.2.2] Using these strategies, many\ntypes of metallic nanoparticles have been produced: nanowires,\nnanoplatelets, nanocubes, pyramids, and other polyhedra. There are ways\nto synthesize nearly any type of particle. These particles have many\nuses. For example, silver nanoparticles are used in clothing and some\nstuffed children's toys as antimicrobial agents. Silver nanowires are\nused commercially as transparent conductive electrodes.[^13.2.3] Small\nmetallic nanoparticles also exhibit a quintessentially nanoscale\nphenomenon called **localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)**, in\nwhich incoming light causes an oscillation of the conduction electrons\nat the interface between the metal and the external environment (i.e.,\nair). The LSPR phenomenon is responsible for the bright colors exhibited\nby some types of metallic nanoparticles. The effect is potentially\nuseful in next-generation forms of medical imaging, light-trapping for\nsolar cells, and even drug delivery.\n\n### 13.2.2. Synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots\n\nAnother class of materials which are commonly synthesized by\nconventional chemical techniques include the synthesis of quantum dots.\nThe exemplar of a quantum dot combines a metal (e.g., cadmium, lead) and\na chalcogenide (i.e., sulfur, selenium, or tellurium). The typical\nexample is cadmium selenide (CdSe)[^13.2.4]. The synthesis is pretty\nstraightforward and can be done in an undergraduate lab. To begin, one\nmakes separate solutions of a selenium and cadmium precursors. Elemental\nselenium comes as a powder and is dissolved in trioctylphosphine, which\nis a liquid. Separately, a cadmium salt such as cadmium acetate\ndihydrate is mixed with oleic acid and octadecene. The two precursor\nsolutions are added simultaneously to a flask with additional solvent\nheld at an elevated temperature. Once the precursors are combined, the\nsolution takes on a color, which evolves over time as the quantum dots\nincrease in size. Aliquots (small samples) can be taken at regular time\nintervals. The longer the reaction goes, the larger the quantum dots\nwill be, and the redder---i.e., lower energy---the emitted fluorescent\nphotons. The total reaction takes about 10 minutes. Once the reaction is\nquenched, the quantum dots are close to **monodisperse**, meaning they\nare all about the same size.[^13.2.5]\n\n### 13.2.3. Synthesis of polymers\n\nPolymers are a fundamental building block of nanoengineered systems.\nThey play roles in both top-down nanofabrication in the form of\nphotoresists, and also in structures produced by bottom-up methods such\nas liposomes and other nanoscale drug-delivery vehicles. Biological\nmacromolecules share many of the same properties as synthetic polymers,\nand the important phenomena in both types of macromolecules are the\nresult of intermolecular, interparticle, and entropic forces that occur\non the nanoscale. In fact, the quintessential measurement of the size of\na polymer molecule in solution is the **radius of gyration**, which has\na scale of several nanometers tens of nanometers.\n\nIn our discussion of synthetic nanoparticles such as quantum dots, we\nmade a point of emphasizing the fact that they all ended up about the\nsame size (i.e., a **dispersity** close to 1). For the synthesis of\npolymers, most high-volume methods of synthesis, including all\nstep-growth polycondensation reactions, along with free-radical\npolymerization reactions, produce molecules with a range of sizes and\nthus values for dispersity \\>1. There are however a few methods that\ngenerate samples with near **monodispersity**. Most of these methods are\ncharacterized as living polymerizations (such as **anionic\npolymerization**, where the formation of bonds between monomers is\nmediated by a formal negative charge) and controlled radical\npolymerization, which, incidentally, are those types of reactions which\nare also amenable to the production of block copolymers. In the living\nor controlled radical polymerization, the reactive end of the growing\nchain reacts one at a time with monomer molecules in solution. This\nsequence of the addition of monomers contrasts with a free radical\npolymerization in which polymer chains grow at different times and\nlengths before spontaneously terminating. With an anionic or controlled\nradical polymerization, the reaction can be stopped after the chains\nreach a predetermined size. This approach permits a kind of chemical\nnanotechnology in which the ability for polymers to, for example,\ninteract with cells, drug molecules, or chemical analytes can be\nprecisely tuned.\n\n### 13.2.4. Dendrimers\n\nA **dendrimer** is a three dimensional polymer that is designed to be\nmonodisperse (see Figure (13.4)). This structure is made in a multistep\nsynthesis in a way that resembles the formation of the bushy top of a\ntree, which grows gradually over many years. Each branch forks to form\nnew branches. The starting material is a multivalent core unit to which\na number of multivalent units are reacted. These units have a protecting\ngroup on them so that they stop growing after a single reaction. The\nprotecting groups are then removed and then another round of reaction\ntakes place, which generates additional branch points. These levels of\nbranching are called **generations**. After multiple generations, one is\nleft with three-dimensional polymer blobs with precisely defined\nstructures. These materials have many potential uses, such as particles\nfor drug delivery and for imaging applications.\n\n(Figure 13.4) \n>>>image(dendrimer.png.0)\n\n[^13.2.1]: A ligand is a molecule that binds to something, typically\n    non-covalently.\n\n[^13.2.2]: The inclusion of such additives is not completely necessary if the\n    crystal in phases add atoms at unequal rates without such\n    interventions.\n\n[^13.2.3]: A transparent conductive electrode (TCO) is a thin film which has,\n    say, 90+% transparency in the visible region of the electromagnetic\n    spectrum. They are critical components of display technologies\n    (there are TCOs covering the front and back of the screen you are\n    looking at right now) and thin-film solar cells. The most common TCO\n    is tin-doped indium oxide (\"ITO\"), which is expensive because of all\n    the indium it uses. In contrast, a thin film of silver nanowires\n    uses maybe a few percent, max, of silver than ITO does of indium.\n    When deposited on a flat piece of glass, silver nanowires form a\n    percolated pathway and allow electricity to travel from one side of\n    the film to the other. The space between the nanowires is optically\n    transparent.\n\n[^13.2.4]: Cool people pronounce it \"cad-sell.\"\n\n[^13.2.5]: This reaction sequence was adapted from Landry, Morrell et al.\n    Simple syntheses of CdSe Quantum Dots *J.
