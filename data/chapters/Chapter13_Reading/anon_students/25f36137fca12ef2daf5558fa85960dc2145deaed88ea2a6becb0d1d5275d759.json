      "content": "#### Section 1: Bottom-up: synthesis and self-assembly\nThe generation of nanostructures can be divided into two separate but\nequally important categories: the top-down processes such as\nphotolithography that make deterministic patterns in two or three\ndimensions in small quantities on a wafer, and the bottom-up processes\nsuch as self-assembly that make copious amounts of structures in a\nflask. This chapter discusses processes of synthesis and\nself-assembly---i.e., **bottom-up**---of nanoscale materials, along with\nan application which has transformed the delivery of cancer therapeutics\nand vaccines. Namely, nanomedicine. For a video primer to this chapter,\nvisit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/SGomGeqy3U8)\n\nIn order to have nanotechnology, you need to be able to create\nnanostructures. In the previous chapter, we covered some of the most\ncommon ways in which nanostructures are produced from top-down methods.\n\"Top down\" means that, like a marble sculpture, the structure in some\nsense already exists inside a slab of material. All that is needed is to\ncut away the extra material, leaving the desired structure(s).[^13.1.1] The\nprocess is sometimes called **subtractive**, in that the bits that are\ncut away are usually discarded. To describe the process in a less\npejorative light than what is implied by the word *subtractive*,\nphotolithography and electron-beam lithography are also often called\n**deterministic**, meaning that the engineer (or artist) knows where the\nmaterials are going to end up in the final structure. Typical materials\nthat are amenable to top-down nanofabrication include silicon, silicon\ndioxide or quartz, other oxides, and metals. Polymeric films such as\nphotoresists are also patterned by the quintessential top-down method,\nphotolithography. Thus, top-down nanofabrication processes are used in\nsome of the most sophisticated manufacturing schemes ever devised for\ncommercial products (i.e., microchips).\n\nIn contrast to top-down nanofabrication, so-called bottom-up processes\nuse thermodynamics, electrostatics, shape recognition, and other\nnaturally occurring phenomena to determine---as if programmed---where\neverything will end up. In bottom-up processes, smaller, unstructured\ncomponents become converted through minimal external intervention into\nfunctional, higher-order structures. A very simple example might be spin\ncoating a photoresist film. That is, a polymer in solution, which\nconsists of disordered molecules floating around, gets cast into a two\ndimensional solid film. This film has macroscopic dimensions and a\nmorphology whose microscopic structure is determined by the molecular\ndetails of the materials from which it is made. Figure (13.1)\nillustrates the differences between top-down and bottom-up approaches to\nnanofabrication, along with some examples of each.\n\n(Figure 13.1) \n>>>image(top-down bottom-up.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.1. Biological structuresThe quintessential example of\nbottom-up fabrication is the self-assembly of biological structures. One\nprominent example is the three-dimensional shape adopted by protein\nmolecules. Protein structure is remarkable because every chemically\nidentical protein molecule (i.e. made up of the same sequence of amino\nacids) will fold up to form a physically identical structure, whereas\nthe physical structures assumed by conventional polymer chains are\nhighly variable, so that polymer structure is understood as a\nstatistical distribution among many possible chain conformations.\nMoreover, the self-assembly of protein molecules is **hierarchical**,\nwith many smaller self-assembled structures self-assembling to make up\nthe final structure. Examples of these multilevel self-assembled\nstructures are alpha helices, beta sheets, and supramolecular\narrangements where multiple peptide chains form a larger, quaternary\nstructure (see Figure (13.2)). The self-assembly of biomolecules is an\nexample from nature that nanotechnologists use as a proof-of-principle\nand indeed inspiration that a bottom-up process might be used to create\nalmost any complex structure with wide-ranging functionality.\n\n(Figure 13.2) \n>>>image(protein.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.2. Micelles, vesicles, and other amphiphilic structures\nMoreover, protein-based nanostructures---and even RNA-based\nnanostructures in cells---are used in biological systems in the form of\nenzymes and other types of molecular machines.[^13.1.2] Such an incredible\narray of functions further motivate engineers, chemists,\nnanotechnologists, and biotechnologists. In fact, the physical structure\nof the cell itself is a supreme example of bottom-up nanofabrication.\nThe cell membrane is an example of a **bilayer vesicle**, part of a\nfamily that includes micelles and inverted micelles, see Figure (13.3).\nIt forms because the molecules that make it up are **amphiphilic**,\nmeaning that part of the molecule likes water and the other part likes\nnonpolar media. In the case of a bilayer vesicle, the amphiphiles pair\nup such that the hydrophobic tail groups point toward each other to make\nup the \"skin\" of the vesicle. At the same time, the ionic head groups\npoint toward the exterior and interior of the vesicle, where the water\nis. The principles at play are the same as those which determine the\nseparation of oil and water in a bottle of salad dressing.\n\n(Figure 13.3) \n>>>image(bilayer vesicle.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.3. Block copolymers Another form of molecular self-assembly\nwhich we have encountered already is the formation of higher ordered\nnanostructures from block copolymers. For example, a polymer chains\ncomposed of two or more chemically dissimilar blocks can be engineered\nto self-assemble themselves into various shapes. Arrays of cylinders,\nlines, lamellar (layer-cake like) structures, and three-dimensional\narrays of spheres can all be generated. Addditionally, the contiguous\ngyroidal structures that can be formed by block copolymer assemblies in\n3-dimensions are not only aesthetically interesting. Many of these\nstructures are useful in technological applications, such as low\ndielectric layers in telecommunications, graphics processors, and\nprinted circuit boards for low-loss transmission of data.\n\n### 13.1.4. Self-assembly Central to the concept of bottom-up\nnanofabrication is the concept of **self-assembly**. Self-assembly is\nthe process by which simple structures become more complex structures.\nThat is, how lower-order structures like molecules and nanoparticles\ncome together to form higher-ordered structures like micelles, bilayer\nvesicles, molecular monolayers, and the shapes formed by block\ncopolymers, and even proteins, cell membranes, and larger biological\nstructures. The difference between \"self-assembly\" and more familiar\nwords such as \"synthesis\" and \"formation\" is not always clear. However,\nit is generally taken that true self-assembly refers to\nthermodynamically reversible processes, whereas synthesis often involves\nchanges in oxidation states, the formation of covalent bonds, and those\nwhich are difficult to reverse or undo without significant effort.\nHowever, as this chapter is not specifically about self-assembly, but\nrather about fabrication using bottom-up processing techniques, we will\nstart with some relevant aspects of synthesis---i.e., of molecules and\nnanoparticles---which is often the first step in bottom-up processes.\nThat is, making the parts that ultimately go into the final manufactured\nproduct.\n\n[^13.1.1]: I think the idea of using tools to reveal what an artist\n    visualized as already existing within a slab of marble originated\n    with Michelangelo.\n\n[^13.1.2]: Indeed, the ribosome---which translates mRNA molecules into\n    protein molecules---is an incredible example of natural molecular\n    manufacturing!\n",
