      "content": "#### Section 1: Bottom-up: synthesis and self-assembly\nThe generation of nanostructures can be divided into two separate but\nequally important categories: the top-down processes such as\nphotolithography that make deterministic patterns in two or three\ndimensions in small quantities on a wafer, and the bottom-up processes\nsuch as self-assembly that make copious amounts of structures in a\nflask. This chapter discusses processes of synthesis and\nself-assembly---i.e., **bottom-up**---of nanoscale materials, along with\nan application which has transformed the delivery of cancer therapeutics\nand vaccines. Namely, nanomedicine. For a video primer to this chapter,\nvisit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/SGomGeqy3U8)\n\nIn order to have nanotechnology, you need to be able to create\nnanostructures. In the previous chapter, we covered some of the most\ncommon ways in which nanostructures are produced from top-down methods.\n\"Top down\" means that, like a marble sculpture, the structure in some\nsense already exists inside a slab of material. All that is needed is to\ncut away the extra material, leaving the desired structure(s).[^13.1.1] The\nprocess is sometimes called **subtractive**, in that the bits that are\ncut away are usually discarded. To describe the process in a less\npejorative light than what is implied by the word *subtractive*,\nphotolithography and electron-beam lithography are also often called\n**deterministic**, meaning that the engineer (or artist) knows where the\nmaterials are going to end up in the final structure. Typical materials\nthat are amenable to top-down nanofabrication include silicon, silicon\ndioxide or quartz, other oxides, and metals. Polymeric films such as\nphotoresists are also patterned by the quintessential top-down method,\nphotolithography. Thus, top-down nanofabrication processes are used in\nsome of the most sophisticated manufacturing schemes ever devised for\ncommercial products (i.e., microchips).\n\nIn contrast to top-down nanofabrication, so-called bottom-up processes\nuse thermodynamics, electrostatics, shape recognition, and other\nnaturally occurring phenomena to determine---as if programmed---where\neverything will end up. In bottom-up processes, smaller, unstructured\ncomponents become converted through minimal external intervention into\nfunctional, higher-order structures. A very simple example might be spin\ncoating a photoresist film. That is, a polymer in solution, which\nconsists of disordered molecules floating around, gets cast into a two\ndimensional solid film. This film has macroscopic dimensions and a\nmorphology whose microscopic structure is determined by the molecular\ndetails of the materials from which it is made. Figure (13.1)\nillustrates the differences between top-down and bottom-up approaches to\nnanofabrication, along with some examples of each.\n\n(Figure 13.1) \n>>>image(top-down bottom-up.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.1. Biological structuresThe quintessential example of\nbottom-up fabrication is the self-assembly of biological structures. One\nprominent example is the three-dimensional shape adopted by protein\nmolecules. Protein structure is remarkable because every chemically\nidentical protein molecule (i.e. made up of the same sequence of amino\nacids) will fold up to form a physically identical structure, whereas\nthe physical structures assumed by conventional polymer chains are\nhighly variable, so that polymer structure is understood as a\nstatistical distribution among many possible chain conformations.\nMoreover, the self-assembly of protein molecules is **hierarchical**,\nwith many smaller self-assembled structures self-assembling to make up\nthe final structure. Examples of these multilevel self-assembled\nstructures are alpha helices, beta sheets, and supramolecular\narrangements where multiple peptide chains form a larger, quaternary\nstructure (see Figure (13.2)). The self-assembly of biomolecules is an\nexample from nature that nanotechnologists use as a proof-of-principle\nand indeed inspiration that a bottom-up process might be used to create\nalmost any complex structure with wide-ranging functionality.\n\n(Figure 13.2) \n>>>image(protein.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.2. Micelles, vesicles, and other amphiphilic structures\nMoreover, protein-based nanostructures---and even RNA-based\nnanostructures in cells---are used in biological systems in the form of\nenzymes and other types of molecular machines.[^13.1.2] Such an incredible\narray of functions further motivate engineers, chemists,\nnanotechnologists, and biotechnologists. In fact, the physical structure\nof the cell itself is a supreme example of bottom-up nanofabrication.\nThe cell membrane is an example of a **bilayer vesicle**, part of a\nfamily that includes micelles and inverted micelles, see Figure (13.3).\nIt forms because the molecules that make it up are **amphiphilic**,\nmeaning that part of the molecule likes water and the other part likes\nnonpolar media. In the case of a bilayer vesicle, the amphiphiles pair\nup such that the hydrophobic tail groups point toward each other to make\nup the \"skin\" of the vesicle. At the same time, the ionic head groups\npoint toward the exterior and interior of the vesicle, where the water\nis. The principles at play are the same as those which determine the\nseparation of oil and water in a bottle of salad dressing.\n\n(Figure 13.3) \n>>>image(bilayer vesicle.png.0)\n\n### 13.1.3. Block copolymers Another form of molecular self-assembly\nwhich we have encountered already is the formation of higher ordered\nnanostructures from block copolymers. For example, a polymer chains\ncomposed of two or more chemically dissimilar blocks can be engineered\nto self-assemble themselves into various shapes. Arrays of cylinders,\nlines, lamellar (layer-cake like) structures, and three-dimensional\narrays of spheres can all be generated. Addditionally, the contiguous\ngyroidal structures that can be formed by block copolymer assemblies in\n3-dimensions are not only aesthetically interesting. Many of these\nstructures are useful in technological applications, such as low\ndielectric layers in telecommunications, graphics processors, and\nprinted circuit boards for low-loss transmission of data.\n\n### 13.1.4. Self-assembly Central to the concept of bottom-up\nnanofabrication is the concept of **self-assembly**. Self-assembly is\nthe process by which simple structures become more complex structures.\nThat is, how lower-order structures like molecules and nanoparticles\ncome together to form higher-ordered structures like micelles, bilayer\nvesicles, molecular monolayers, and the shapes formed by block\ncopolymers, and even proteins, cell membranes, and larger biological\nstructures. The difference between \"self-assembly\" and more familiar\nwords such as \"synthesis\" and \"formation\" is not always clear. However,\nit is generally taken that true self-assembly refers to\nthermodynamically reversible processes, whereas synthesis often involves\nchanges in oxidation states, the formation of covalent bonds, and those\nwhich are difficult to reverse or undo without significant effort.\nHowever, as this chapter is not specifically about self-assembly, but\nrather about fabrication using bottom-up processing techniques, we will\nstart with some relevant aspects of synthesis---i.e., of molecules and\nnanoparticles---which is often the first step in bottom-up processes.\nThat is, making the parts that ultimately go into the final manufactured\nproduct.\n\n[^13.1.1]: I think the idea of using tools to reveal what an artist\n    visualized as already existing within a slab of marble originated\n    with Michelangelo.\n\n[^13.1.2]: Indeed, the ribosome---which translates mRNA molecules into\n    protein molecules---is an incredible example of natural molecular\n    manufacturing!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Synthesis\nThe process of synthesis in principle encompasses everything ever used\nin the field of chemistry to make stuff: drugs, plastics, fuels,\ncoatings, food additives, and so forth. However, we find that once we\nlimit ourselves to the synthesis of higher order structures with\nnanoscale dimensions (dimensions larger than typical molecules), we\nwhittle the list down to only a few of the most common examples. These\ninclude nanoparticles based on metals and semiconductors (**metallic\nnanoparticles** and **quantum dots**), along with those made from\npolymers (including individual polymer chains and sphere-like\n**dendrimers**).\n\n### 13.2.1. Synthesis of zero dimensional metal nanoparticles\n\nSince the development of **electron microscopy** (including scanning\nelectron microscopy, **SEM**, and transmission electron microscopy,\n**TEM**), chemists have been interested in synthesizing metallic\nnanoparticles whose three-dimensional shapes can be readily verified. In\ngeneral, these methods involve the chemical reduction of a metal salt\nwhere the metal comes out of the bottle in oxidized form (e.g., gold\nnanoparticles are made using chloroauric acid, H\\[AuCl$_4$\\], where gold\nhas the oxidation state of 3+). It is typical to add a polymer into the\nmixture to prevent aggregation of the particles during growth and\nthereafter. The polymer prevents aggregation by polymer-mediated steric\nforces, a type of repulsive force of entropic origin covered in Chapter\n3. Very often, one or more types of surfactants or metal ligands are\nused as well.[^13.2.1] Often, a surfactant to afford solubility is used as\nwell. The ligands or surfactants are often amphiphilic molecules such as\nan alkane thiol (RSH) or a trialkylphospine oxide. Such molecules bind\nselectively to certain crystallographic faces of the growing crystalline\nnanoparticle and thus block further growth at that face. The other faces\ngrow in unencumbered. This strategy is used as a means of obtaining\nnanoparticles with specific shapes.[^13.2.2] Using these strategies, many\ntypes of metallic nanoparticles have been produced: nanowires,\nnanoplatelets, nanocubes, pyramids, and other polyhedra. There are ways\nto synthesize nearly any type of particle. These particles have many\nuses. For example, silver nanoparticles are used in clothing and some\nstuffed children's toys as antimicrobial agents. Silver nanowires are\nused commercially as transparent conductive electrodes.[^13.2.3] Small\nmetallic nanoparticles also exhibit a quintessentially nanoscale\nphenomenon called **localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)**, in\nwhich incoming light causes an oscillation of the conduction electrons\nat the interface between the metal and the external environment (i.e.,\nair). The LSPR phenomenon is responsible for the bright colors exhibited\nby some types of metallic nanoparticles. The effect is potentially\nuseful in next-generation forms of medical imaging, light-trapping for\nsolar cells, and even drug delivery.\n\n### 13.2.2. Synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots\n\nAnother class of materials which are commonly synthesized by\nconventional chemical techniques include the synthesis of quantum dots.\nThe exemplar of a quantum dot combines a metal (e.g., cadmium, lead) and\na chalcogenide (i.e., sulfur, selenium, or tellurium). The typical\nexample is cadmium selenide (CdSe)[^13.2.4]. The synthesis is pretty\nstraightforward and can be done in an undergraduate lab. To begin, one\nmakes separate solutions of a selenium and cadmium precursors. Elemental\nselenium comes as a powder and is dissolved in trioctylphosphine, which\nis a liquid. Separately, a cadmium salt such as cadmium acetate\ndihydrate is mixed with oleic acid and octadecene. The two precursor\nsolutions are added simultaneously to a flask with additional solvent\nheld at an elevated temperature. Once the precursors are combined, the\nsolution takes on a color, which evolves over time as the quantum dots\nincrease in size. Aliquots (small samples) can be taken at regular time\nintervals. The longer the reaction goes, the larger the quantum dots\nwill be, and the redder---i.e., lower energy---the emitted fluorescent\nphotons. The total reaction takes about 10 minutes. Once the reaction is\nquenched, the quantum dots are close to **monodisperse**, meaning they\nare all about the same size.[^13.2.5]\n\n### 13.2.3. Synthesis of polymers\n\nPolymers are a fundamental building block of nanoengineered systems.\nThey play roles in both top-down nanofabrication in the form of\nphotoresists, and also in structures produced by bottom-up methods such\nas liposomes and other nanoscale drug-delivery vehicles. Biological\nmacromolecules share many of the same properties as synthetic polymers,\nand the important phenomena in both types of macromolecules are the\nresult of intermolecular, interparticle, and entropic forces that occur\non the nanoscale. In fact, the quintessential measurement of the size of\na polymer molecule in solution is the **radius of gyration**, which has\na scale of several nanometers tens of nanometers.\n\nIn our discussion of synthetic nanoparticles such as quantum dots, we\nmade a point of emphasizing the fact that they all ended up about the\nsame size (i.e., a **dispersity** close to 1). For the synthesis of\npolymers, most high-volume methods of synthesis, including all\nstep-growth polycondensation reactions, along with free-radical\npolymerization reactions, produce molecules with a range of sizes and\nthus values for dispersity \\>1. There are however a few methods that\ngenerate samples with near **monodispersity**. Most of these methods are\ncharacterized as living polymerizations (such as **anionic\npolymerization**, where the formation of bonds between monomers is\nmediated by a formal negative charge) and controlled radical\npolymerization, which, incidentally, are those types of reactions which\nare also amenable to the production of block copolymers. In the living\nor controlled radical polymerization, the reactive end of the growing\nchain reacts one at a time with monomer molecules in solution. This\nsequence of the addition of monomers contrasts with a free radical\npolymerization in which polymer chains grow at different times and\nlengths before spontaneously terminating. With an anionic or controlled\nradical polymerization, the reaction can be stopped after the chains\nreach a predetermined size. This approach permits a kind of chemical\nnanotechnology in which the ability for polymers to, for example,\ninteract with cells, drug molecules, or chemical analytes can be\nprecisely tuned.\n\n### 13.2.4. Dendrimers\n\nA **dendrimer** is a three dimensional polymer that is designed to be\nmonodisperse (see Figure (13.4)). This structure is made in a multistep\nsynthesis in a way that resembles the formation of the bushy top of a\ntree, which grows gradually over many years. Each branch forks to form\nnew branches. The starting material is a multivalent core unit to which\na number of multivalent units are reacted. These units have a protecting\ngroup on them so that they stop growing after a single reaction. The\nprotecting groups are then removed and then another round of reaction\ntakes place, which generates additional branch points. These levels of\nbranching are called **generations**. After multiple generations, one is\nleft with three-dimensional polymer blobs with precisely defined\nstructures. These materials have many potential uses, such as particles\nfor drug delivery and for imaging applications.\n\n(Figure 13.4) \n>>>image(dendrimer.png.0)\n\n[^13.2.1]: A ligand is a molecule that binds to something, typically\n    non-covalently.\n\n[^13.2.2]: The inclusion of such additives is not completely necessary if the\n    crystal in phases add atoms at unequal rates without such\n    interventions.\n\n[^13.2.3]: A transparent conductive electrode (TCO) is a thin film which has,\n    say, 90+% transparency in the visible region of the electromagnetic\n    spectrum. They are critical components of display technologies\n    (there are TCOs covering the front and back of the screen you are\n    looking at right now) and thin-film solar cells. The most common TCO\n    is tin-doped indium oxide (\"ITO\"), which is expensive because of all\n    the indium it uses. In contrast, a thin film of silver nanowires\n    uses maybe a few percent, max, of silver than ITO does of indium.\n    When deposited on a flat piece of glass, silver nanowires form a\n    percolated pathway and allow electricity to travel from one side of\n    the film to the other. The space between the nanowires is optically\n    transparent.\n\n[^13.2.4]: Cool people pronounce it \"cad-sell.\"\n\n[^13.2.5]: This reaction sequence was adapted from Landry, Morrell et al.\n    Simple syntheses of CdSe Quantum Dots *J.

      "content": "#### Section 3: Self-assembly\nSelf-assembly is superficially similar to synthesis, except that in\nself-assembly, the bonds that form are ionic or van der Waals as opposed\nto metallic or covalent. Moreover, such bonds based on electrostatic\ninteractions tend to be more transient and are more likely to be\nreversible than covalent bonds. Reversibility is the hallmark of\nprocesses of self-assembly. For example, ionic bonds and van der Waals\nbonds permit the materials to reconfigure in response to environmental\nconditions, such as changes in local pH, temperature, or stimulation by\noptical wavelengths. Here, we discuss a few types of self-assembly of\ninterest in nanoengineered systems: the formation of micelles and\nbilayer vesicles, the formation of self assembled monolayers on metals\nand silica, and the separation of unlike polymers, including the\nformation of block copolymer micro- and nanostructures.\n\n### 13.3.1. Micelles\n\nA micelle is a self-assembled structure containing amphiphilic\nmolecules. The name **amphiphile** is derived from Greek meaning that\nthe molecules \"love\" two different kinds of media---possessing both\nhydrophilic and lipophilic[^13.3.1] properties---at the same time. A\nquintessential example of an amphiphilic molecule is sodium dodecyl\nsufate (SDS, also known as sodium lauryl sulfate), the active component\nof soap. These molecules contain a hydrophilic end group such as a\nsulfate or phosphate. This negatively charged hydrophilic group\nassociates with the partial positive charges of the hydrogen atoms of\nnearby water molecules. The dodecyl group of the SDS molecule, on the\nother hand, is hydrophobic. Water molecules, for their part, prefer to\nbe associated with each other because they can form cages of hydrogen\nbonds which---as we discussed in Chapter 2---are highly energetically\nfavorable. Moreover, the formation of such ordered, cage-like structures\naround hydrophobic and amphiphilic solutes allows other water molecules\nto float away in solution. The freedom these water molecules have is\nentropically favorable. At sufficiently high concentrations of\nSDS---**the critical micelle concentration (CMC)**---these alkyl chains\nassociate with one another and form a sphere called a **micelle**. The\ninterior of the sphere can trap hydrophobic grease, waxes, and oils,\nwhich is why SDS and other similar amphiphiles are used so commonly in\nsoaps, shampoos, and detergents.\n\nTo review, the driving force for this archetypal process of\nself-assembly is both electrostatic *and* entropic. It is electrostatic\nbecause the dipoles of the water in the surrounding media coordinated\nwith the charged groups of the polar head group of the amphiphile, and\nentropic because the water molecules that would have preferred to\nassociate with the hydrophobic tail groups of the amphiphile are now\nfree to circulate freely in the water bulk. Micelles are thus spherical\nobjects with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic exterior. Such is the\nsituation in aqueous environments. However, when amphiphiles like SDS\nare placed in some types of non-polar or hydrophobic media---e.g.,\ncertain types of organic solvents---the micelle turns inside out. That\nis, an **inverted micelle**, with the hydrophobic tails on the outside\nand the hydrophilic groups on the inside.\n\n#### Critical micelle concentration (CMC)\n\nIt is important to note however that micelles do not form immediately\nwith the first few molecules of amphiphile added to water. The reason is\nthat entropy is powerful and if molecules can afford energetically to\nremain free in the solution, they will do so. Moreover, there are many\ninterfaces in a solution of water with which an amphiphilic molecule\nmight profitably interact. (That is, with respect to electrostatic\npotential energy.) For example, the interface with the glass or plastic\ncontainer and also the interface between the liquid and the air. Once\nthese surfaces are saturated with molecules at a surface density of\naround 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, and the solution holds as many individual\namphiphilic molecules as it can, micelles start to form. This\nconcentration is known as the **critical micelle concentration** (CMC),\nand again, is the concentration of molecules in solution at which\nmicelles start to form. The CMC is a parameter that depends on the shape\nof the amphiphilic molecule and its interfacial free energy with the\nliquid medium (that is, water in most cases).\n\nWe note that the concentration at any point reflects only the\nconcentration of monomers, micelles, and monomers in micelles that are\nactually in the solution. Those molecules which had adsorbed to the\nvessel walls or the interface with the air do not count. Also, it is\nvery easy to disrupt the concentration of micelles by introducing other\ninterfaces into the mix. For example, blowing a fine mist of air bubbles\nfrom a hose in the water will immediately cause molecules of the\namphiphile to associate with the bubble, even if those amphiphilic\nmolecules have to be recruited away from existing micelles in solution.\nThe same goes for other hydrophobic solutes, like oil droplets, which\nwill also tend to pull molecules out of the solution and toward these\ninterfaces. Note that molecules associated with interfaces---including\nthe liquid-air interface at the top of a container, the sidewalls of the\ncontainer, and the surfaces of any bubbles or droplets of gas or\noil---do not count toward the total concentration of amphiphilic\nmolecules (or any molecules) in solution.\n\n### 13.3.2. Bilayer vesicles\n\nThe type of structure formed by amphiphiles in solution depends not only\non the chemical composition of the amphiphile, but also on its shape.\nFor example, a molecule like sodium dodecyl sulfate looks approximately\nlike a narrow cone, in terms of electron density: the polar sulfate\ngroup is relatively large compared to the skinny alkyl chain. However, a\n**phospholipid** which has a large head group but *two* alkyl chains, is\nmore uniform along its length and can thus be approximated as a\ncylinder. So, a conical amphiphile might form a spherical structure\n(micelle), whereas a cylindrical amplifier will would form a\n**bilayer**. A bilayer by itself would not be stable because the edges\nwould still be relatively high in surface energy. Thus, a bilayer balls\nup on itself to form a **bilayer vesicle**. Bilayer vesicles were\nbelieved to form some of the first proto-cells on the early Earth and\nalso serve as the phospholipid bilayer membrane of biological cells.\nBilayer vesicles are also used as the scaffolds of **liposomes**,\nself-assembled nanoparticles used ubiquitously to encapsulate drugs for\nchemotherapy or mRNA vaccines.\n\n### 13.3.3. Molecular monolayers\n\nA critical type of structure in micro and nanofabrication, and also in\nbiophysical studies in the biopharmaceutical industry is the **molecular\nmonolayer**. There are two major types of molecular monolayers of\nimportance in these industries as well as research laboratories:\nself-assembled monolayers of alkene thiolates on coinage metals (and\nalso self-assembled monolayers of electrostatically coordinated alkyl\nphosphates on oxide surfaces of other metals) and covalently bound\nmolecular monolayers of silanes on oxidized silicon,\n\n#### Self assembled monolayers of alkane thiolates on coinage metals\n\nThe most famous type of self-assembled monolayer is that of a\nsulfur-containing small molecule and its interaction with a coinage\nmetal surface. The class of elements known as coinage metal---often\ncalled **noble metals**---include gold, silver, palladium, and\nplatinum.[^13.3.2] Self-assembled monolayers (\"SAMs\" for short, see Figure\n(13.5)), are formed because of a very strong interaction that occurs\nbetween the empty molecular orbitals of a coinage metal, and the lone\npairs of electrons of the sulfur atom. The bond between the sulfur and\nmetal atoms is nearly as strong as a covalent bond. Yet, these bonds can\nbe swapped around so that the molecules making up the SAM are\neffectively mobile on the surface. They can also be exchanged. For\nexample, if a surface containing a SAM with an alkyl chain length of 4\ncarbon atoms is placed in a bath with molecules with side chain lengths\nof 8 atoms, the surface will eventually be replaced with molecules with\n8 carbon atoms, simply because there is a huge reservoir of molecules in\nsolution relative to those on the surface.[^13.3.3]\n\n(Figure 13.5) \n>>>image(SAMs.png.0)\n\nThe strong bond formed between the sulfur atom and the metal is only\npart of the driving force for the formation of a SAM. The other part is\nthe favorable van der Waals interactions between the alkyl side chains.\nRemember from Chapter 2 that the strength of a van der Waals interaction\nbetween molecules increases by about $\\frac{3}{2}kT$ per CH$_2$ unit.\nSo, the longer the alkyl chains in the SAM, the greater the *cohesive\nenergy* holding the SAM together.\n\nThe most common molecular precursor from which SAMs are made is the\n**alkane thiol, RSH**, where R can be any alkyl group. When the molecule\nbinds, it is believed that the hydrogen atoms come off, pair up, and\nleave as H$_2$ gas. It is also possible to form a SAM from an alkyl\ndisulfide, RS-SR, where the bond between sulfur atoms breaks and each\nleftover RS group binds to the surface individually. In this case, there\nis no hydrogen atom to be released. A type of SAM which binds more\nweakly to the surface, but which forms nonetheless is a dialkyl sulfide,\nor R$_2$S, where each sulfur atom has two alkyl groups. In all cases,\nthe R group can be tailored to contain functional groups. This\ncapability is absolutely key to the usefulness of SAMS: because of the\nstrong interaction energy of sulfur with metals, it is possible to place\nnearly any functional group at the surface of any metallic nanoparticle\nor surface at a very high density. For example, SAMs may contain\ninitiation sites for polymerization, binding of ligands for protein\ninteraction, and sites to tailor the surface energy.\n\n#### Other SAMs\n\nThere are other types of SAMs, notably negatively charged ions on oxide\nsurfaces. For example, alkyl chains terminated with a charged\nphosphonate ion bind to oxide surfaces (e.g., titanium oxide), but with\nless strength than the bond of thiols to coinage or noble metals.\n\n### 13.3.4. Silane monolayers on silicon oxide\n\nSilicon is among the most important materials in modern technology and\nubiquitous in nanoengineered systems, particularly those made by\ntop-down methods of fabrication. The usefulness of silicon derives from\nits semiconducting properties---as in solar cells, microprocessors, and\nmemory chips---but also the ability to form ultraflat wafers and to\nfashion it into a variety of microdevices by photolithography. An\nimportant enabling aspect of silicon nanotechnology is the ability to\nmodify the surface properties. For example, the adhesion of silicon to\nother materials (or other silicon devices) can be modified by changing\nthe dipole moment at the surface and thus the surface energy. The\nprimary way to do this is by modification with a molecular monolayer.\n\nBefore discussing the types of silane monolayers, it is worthwhile to\ntake a closer look at the silicon surface. Like most metals, which are\nquickly oxidized in air, the surface of silicon is covered with a\n**native oxide** layer around 2 nm thick. This oxide layer grows on most\nmetals in ambient air simply because of the presence of oxygen in the\natmosphere. The thickness of this native oxide layer is said to be\n**self-limited**---it never gets any thicker unless it is exposed to\nplasma, a chemical treatment, or heated to several hundred degrees.[^13.3.4]\nThe oxidized surface is terminated with OH groups, so the last atom on\nan oxidized surface is a highly polar species reminiscent of an alcohol.\nThe hydrogen atom can donate a hydrogen bond to a negatively charged ion\nand the lone pairs of the oxygen atoms can be used to form covalent\nbonds with reactive, **electrophilic**, molecules.\n\nThe typical reagents used to modify the surface of silicon are also\nbased on silicon, that is **silane monolayers**. Silane molecules that\nmake up silane monolayers have the general form RSiX$_3$, where X is\nusually Cl or RO. That is, it is either a trichloro or trialkoxy silane.\nThis valency of three allows the silane to react with three terminal\nOH---**silanol**---groups on the surface.\n\n[^13.3.1]: More commonly described in nanoengineering as the antonym to\n    hydrophilic, **hydrophobic**\n\n[^13.3.2]: While copper is sometimes considered a coinage metal for these\n    purposes, it tends to oxidize more so than the others, and is less\n    amenable to the formation of self assembled monolayers.\n\n[^13.3.3]: The surface density of atoms or densely packed groups on a surface\n    is ca. 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$.\n\n[^13.3.4]: The self-limited nature of the native oxide arises because once\n    the oxide reaches a certain thickness, electrons are unable to\n    exchange by **quantum tunneling** with the oxygen in the ambient\n    air.\n",

Biomedical nanotechnology includes a\nrange of devices, such as wearable and implantable sensors of various\nphysiological signals and chemical analytes (a field collectively known\nas **bioelectronics**), as well as *ex vivo* (outside the body) sensors\nused in genetic sequencing and other forms of molecular diagnostics.\nNanoengineered solutions have also been proposed and successfully\ncommercialized as **biomaterials** for medical instruments (e.g., which\ninterface with the brain or nervous system) as well as constructs for\n**tissue engineering** and **regenerative medicine**. Given the scope of\nnanomedicine---for which there are several excellent textbooks---our\nfocus in this section will be on the use of nanoparticles of various\ntypes as agents for drug delivery, targeting, and evasion of the immune\nsystem. Here, we will give a brief glimpse of the rationale, materials,\nand successes of these approaches, but know that there is a much larger\nbody of books, literature, and videos on YouTube and other places, for\nthose interested.\n\n### 13.4.1. Nanomedicine in cancer therapeutics\n\nCancer is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The\ndifficulty in treating cancer arises to a large extent because the\ncancerous tissue is embedded within otherwise healthy tissue. Thus,\ntargeting tumor cells---either with a scalpel, radiation, or\nchemotherapy---is notoriously difficult. Moreover, drug molecules are\nforeign species that are often targeted for removal by the immune\nsystem. They also suffer from poor solubility and can form solid\n**emboli** when injected. These solid structures can block vasculature\nand lead to loss of oxygen to vital organs. Thus, engineered\nnanoparticles which can solubilize therapeutic molecules, evade the\nimmune system and target cancerous tissue without damaging healthy\ntissue are critical tools in anticancer therapy.\n\n#### Characteristics of cancer cells and tumors\n\nCancer refers to the out-of-control growth of formerly healthy cells\nthat exhibit either a **congenital abnormality** or **oncogene**, or\ngenetic defect that arose from some external factor, i.e. sun exposure,\ncarcinogenic chemicals, or ionizing radiation. Such cells associate with\none another to form a solid mass called a tumor. The presence of a tumor\nhas many consequences on normal physiological function, not the least of\nwhich is the physical bulk of the tumor itself. This mass presses on\nother organs, reroutes blood supply, and consumes space and resources\nneeded for healthy tissue. Moreover, cancer cells can break free of the\nsolid mass and take root in other locations in the body in a process\ncalled **metastasis**.\n\n#### Passive targeting\n\nWhile derived from healthy cells, cancer cells and tumors exhibit\ndifferences from the normal cells in healthy tissue that can be\nexploited by particular strategies of drug delivery. For example, tumors\nhave leaky vasculature, meaning that the walls of the blood vessels are\nporous. This hack plumbing job is the basis for the targeting approach\nknown as **enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)**, see Figure\n(13.6). In EPR, nanoparticles of a size small enough to fit through the\nleaky sidewalls of the vasculature tend to concentrate in the\nextravascular space. Once inside the tumor, such particles are unlikely\nto find their way back into the circulatory system (does leaked water\never end up back inside the pipe?). The EPR effect thus represents a\nmode known as **passive targeting**, in which therapeutic molecules\nnaturally find their ways to the right places.[^13.4.1] Another way in which\nthe tumor microenvironment is different from that of the surrounding\nhealthy environment is the pH. Tumor tissue tends to be lower in pH than\nthe surrounding tissue. Thus, nanoparticles that can be activated by\nacid-base mediated reactions may be used to release their drug payload\nselectively at the tumor site in a passive targeting manner.\n\n(Figure 13.6) \n>>>image(EPR.png.0)\n\n#### Active targeting\n\nIn contrast to the passive targeting approach described above, where no\nintervention is needed on the part of the medical provider, active\ntargeting approaches have also been applied to cancer therapy. For\nexample, nanoparticles exhibiting ferromagnetic components can be\ndirected toward the tumor site by the external application of a magnetic\nfield. Similarly, thermally or photothermally actived nanoparticles can\nbe engineered to release their drugs only in the vicinity of the tumor\nusing the external application of heat or light. Tumor cells may also\nexhibit unusual chemical signatures on their surfaces, which can be\ntargeted for destruction by engineered nanoparticles or other biological\nstructures in a methodology called **cancer immunotherapy**.\n\n### 13.4.2. Types of nanoparticles\n\nMany types of nanoparticles have been used for encapsulates for\ntherapeutic agents or as therapeutic agents themselves. The earliest\nform of nanoparticle drug delivery system is the use of a **liposome**.\nA liposome is a self-assembled structure whose basic form is that of a\nbilayer vesicle. A bilayer vesicle is superficially similar to a cell\nenvelope, and bears many of the same features as a micelle. The\nstructure of a liposome is shown in Figure (13.3). Liposomes can be used\nto to encapsulate hydrophilic drugs such as proteins, nucleic acids, and\nsmall molecules bearing a negative or positive charge. They can also be\nused to solubilize hydrophobic small molecules, which reside in the\nlipophilic skin of the bilayer vesicle. The simplest way to form a\ndrug-loaded liposome is to take the drug molecules, concentrate them\ndown by evaporating any solvent, add the amphiphilic lipids, and\nre-suspend the drug. The surfaces of liposomes can also be modified\nusing molecules with a component that inserts into the lipophilic\nbilayer. Such liposomes can thus be engineered to present carbohydrates\nand proteins at the surface of the molecule (i.e., signaling molecules)\nto find their way to the tumor site and/or to release their drug\npayloads once there.\n\n#### Polymeric nanoparticles\n\nAnother type of drug delivery vehicle is based on polymers. As roughly\nspherical blobs containing a high fraction of solvent, polymers in\nsolution are basically nanoparticles. They can also be engineered to\nexhibit the properties of controlled degradation and can be either\nloaded with or coated with drug molecules. Polymers can either be\ncross-linked or uncrosslinked, and can be in a sense \"programmed\" to\ndegrade either under physiological conditions or to remain intact to be\ncleared from the system some other way. Cross-linked polymers, like\nhydrogel-based nanoparticles, are designed to release their payload\ngradually, as water from the bloodstream infiltrates the particles and\ndissolves the drugs. Crosslinked and uncrosslinked nanoparticles---and\nindeed most engineered drug delivery systems---can also non-selectively\nadsorb drug molecules to the surface. Once infused into the patients,\nthese physisorbed drug molecules tend to release all at once, the\nundesirable but sometimes unavoidable phenomenon known as **burst\nrelease**. Given the high ratio of surface area to volume of\nnanoparticles, the burst release can actually introduce as many drug\nmolecules into the bloodstream as are contained in the interior,\ndepending on the size of the particle and the size of the drug molecule.\nFigure (13.7) illustrates a few types of polymeric nanoparticles as well\nas the burst release process.\n\n(Figure 13.7) \n>>>image(polymer and burst release.png.0)\n\n#### Inorganic nanoparticles\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, nanostructures based on metals and\noxides offer many potenitally useful approaches to delivering drug\nmolecules. For example, metallic nanoparticles exhibit localized surface\nplasmon resonances (LSPRs) which can cause nanoparticles to heat up.\nThis approach could either be used to target cancer directly by\neffectively burning and killing the cancer cells, or it could be used to\nmelt a shell of the nanoparticles to release drug molecules from the\ninterior. The use of ferromagnetic nanoparticles---which might contain\niron or nickel---as a means of guiding them to the target site has\nalready been discussed in the context of active targeting approaches.\n\n### 13.4.3. Nanoparticles for biomedical imaging\n\nBiomedical imaging includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed\ntomography (CT), ultrasound, and X-ray imaging. All of these techniques\nrequire or benefit from the use of contrast agents. In many cases, one\nwishes to put a contrast agent as close to the site of injury as\npossible. If you have ever received an X-ray for a broken bone, you will\nrecall the little steel ball that they stick to your skin where it\nhurts, so that the radiologist knows where to look. Sometimes, targeting\nnanoparticles to cancer sites and the sites of injury in imaging studies\nserve a similar function. That is, they are designed to migrate to the\nsite of injury (or tumor).\n\nThus, nanoparticles exhibiting photothermal, photoemissive, magnetic, or\nphotoacoustic properties have been used to enhance existing imaging\ntechnologies. As an example, **photoacoustic imaging** is the use of\nlight pulses to generate periodic fluctuations in temperature which in\nturn produces acoustic signals, which, needless to say, are inaudible to\nthe human ear. Nevertheless, these sound waves can be picked up by a\nconventional ultrasound transducer---like the ones used to obtain images\nof fetuses during pregnancy. Photoacoustic imaging is enabled by the use\nof a molecular dye or nanoparticle that captures light either by\nelectronic absorption or by localized surface plasmon resonance. After\nabsorption occurs, the molecule or particle de-excites and in the\nprocess generates a small amount of heat, which is quickly dissipated.\nThus, the frequency of the light pulses become the frequency of the\nsound generated. Photoacoustic imaging thus follows the mnemonic of\n\"light in, sound out.\"\n\n### 13.4.4. Nanomedicine for vaccine delivery\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought to the public eye many methods for\ngenerating an immune response to a novel pathogen, in this case, the\n\"novel coronavirus,\" SARS-CoV-2. These approaches for the rapid---at\ntimes scrambling---development of a new vaccine spanned a range of\ntechnologies, including the traditional method of chemical inactivation\nof a live virus, the use of adenoviruses to deliver genetic instructions\nfor the production of proteins found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, and\nthe use of mRNA molecules encoding this protein delivered directly to\nthe cells.[^13.4.2] However, mRNA molecules are readily hydrolyzed---i.e.,\nbroken down---under physiological conditions. Moreover, once inside the\nbloodstream, they are not likely to enter the cell on their own. The use\nof **lipid nanoparticles** can address these concerns by (1) providing a\nprotected environment for the mRNA molecules and (2) having molecules at\nthe surface that encourage merging with the cell membrane. Once inside\nthe cell, the mRNA molecules are translated into the spike protein by\nthe cellular ribosome. These spike proteins circulate in the bloodstream\nand are recognized by the immune system, which produces antibodies.\n\n### 13.4.5. Retention and clearance of nanoparticles\n\nMost of the nanoparticles introduced into the bloodstream for either\ntherapeutic or imaging applications eventually have to be removed. If\nleft to circulate, such nanoparticles may occlude blood vessels, become\nstuck in internal organs, or degrade into unhealthy byproducts. The\nprocess by which normally functioning organs remove the foreign material\nover time is called **clearance**. Thus, the nanoparticles must be\nengineered such that they remain in the system longer---i.e.,\n**retention**. Nanoparticles must have sufficient time in the\nbloodstream to give the desired therapeutic effect, while not\noverstaying their welcome. The factors which determine what organ system\nremoves the nanoparticles from the bloodstream include the size,\ncomposition, surface charge, and even shape of the nanoparticles. While\nmany excellent resources exist for the interested reader, suffice it to\nsay that very small nanoparticles, smaller than 5 nm, get filtered out\nof the bloodstream by the kidneys and are expelled in the urine. Other\nparticles are engulfed and degraded by cells of the immune system, while\nothers are destined for the liver, where they are broken down. Larger\nparticles may be filtered by the spleen, though too much accumulation\nthere can degrade the function of the spleen. If a particle is destined\nfor the liver or the spleen, there must be a mechanism to break it down,\notherwise the fine blood vessels located in these organs may be\noccluded, which can cause an **infarct**, or death of tissue due to\nhypoxia (loss of oxygenation).\n\n[^13.4.1]: The EPR effect is the subject of some controversy, given\n    observations of some researchers that the concentration of\n    nanoparticles found in tumor tissue is not greatly enriched compared\n    to that found in other parts of the body.\n\n[^13.4.2]: The protein usually targeted is the so-called **spike protein**.\n    The moniker \"spike\" has more to do with its function, i.e., to\n    attach itself to a cell like a thistle plant, as opposed to its\n    shape, which looks more like a toilet plunger.\n",

In some fictional\nworks, these micron-sized vehicles are envisioned to attack cancer cells\nor other invading species by something like conscious will. While we are\nmany decades from that kind of reality, some research which hints at\nsuch a future has started to emerge. For example, **microswimmers** have\nbeen created from a variety of materials. These devices often use\nchemical species found in the bloodstream or other microenvironments as\nfuels for propulsion. As of now, the guidance of these systems is\ngenerally under external control. Moreover, greater functionality could\nbe achieved if these micron-sized \"nanobots\" could be scaled down to\ntruly cellular or even molecular dimensions, could communicate with one\nanother, and could find their way without external intervention. In\ntime, however, it seems that such \"smart\" nanoengineered approaches to\nmedical puzzles will eventually be developed.\n",
