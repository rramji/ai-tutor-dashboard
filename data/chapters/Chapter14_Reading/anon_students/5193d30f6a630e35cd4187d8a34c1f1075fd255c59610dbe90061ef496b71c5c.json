      "content": "#### Section 1: Invisible worlds\nMaterials and phenomena that occur on the nanoscale are, almost by\ndefinition, too small for the human visual sense. Nevertheless, we\nreally do know their shapes, sizes, and compositions. To obtain this\ninformation, we rely on techniques of **characterization**. Namely, on\nthe two closely related areas of **spectroscopy** and *imaging*.\nSpectroscopy is the processes by which matter is bombarded with some\ntype of particle or radiation, and the particles that are scattered,\ntransmitted, or re-emitted are analyzed for clues about the structure.\nImaging techniques use a similar paradigm, but the end goal is not to\nproduce a quantitative spectrum but a visual image for processing (often\nby the human brain). There are many modalities which combine\nspectroscopy and imaging in a single instrument. For a video primer to\nthis chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/N18UhNQmI8o)\n\nOne of the things that differentiates science from everyday rational\nbehavior is that science needs special tools to overcome the limits of\nhuman senses. We can only learn so much about the world from our senses\nof sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. While we can determine some\nthings about the structure and properties of matter from our five basic\nsenses, we need to correlate these observations to information gleaned\nfrom other tools. Nowhere is the augmentation of human senses more\nnecessary than in nanoengineering, where everything is way too small to\nsee with even the most powerful optical microscopes. For example, a\nnanoparticle or quantum dot might have a diameter of 5 nm, but the\nsmallest wavelength of light that can be detected by the human eye is\nabout 400 nm, which corresponds to violet light. So, we are blind to\nnanomaterials. That's why we can't see viruses billowing out of people's\nmouths and noses, and it's also why we can't see the intricate details\nof a computer microprocessor at the level of the transistor, even under\nthe highest possible magnification with a conventional microscope.\n\nThus, there is a conundrum posed by the diffraction limit of light. The\nway to circumvent this problem is to use particles other than visible\nphotons, such as electrons, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, or even helium\nnuclei. These approaches are analogous to optical microscopy in that\nthey use wavelike particles to interact with matter, and the image is\ncreated from the ways in which light is absorbed or scattered from the\nsurface.\n\nSuch methods of obtaining images of nanoscale objects are not limited\nonly to modalities which shine---or blast---light or particles upon the\nsample. The other major way in which information is collected about the\ncomposition and structure of nanoscale materials is not by shining a\nbeam from a distance, but rather by physical contact or near-physical\ncontact, in methods that are akin not to the sense of vision but to the\nsense of touch. Such approaches are referred to collectively as\n\"scanning probe\" techniques. The feature that all scanning probe\ninstruments have in common is the use of a sharp object which scans\nalong a surface (like a vinyl or LP player). The tip can be used to plot\nthe topography, mechanical properties, conductivity, chemical\ncomposition, or other properties of the surface. Finally, there are\ntechniques which use radiation not to generate images, but to probe the\nstructure of atoms, molecules, particles, and surfaces. These\nspectroscopic modalities rely on the basic physics we have covered in\ndetail in Chapter 8, so we will begin here.\n",
