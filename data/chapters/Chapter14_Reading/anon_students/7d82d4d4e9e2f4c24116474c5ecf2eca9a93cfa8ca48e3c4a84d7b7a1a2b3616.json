      "content": "#### Section 1: Invisible worlds\nMaterials and phenomena that occur on the nanoscale are, almost by\ndefinition, too small for the human visual sense. Nevertheless, we\nreally do know their shapes, sizes, and compositions. To obtain this\ninformation, we rely on techniques of **characterization**. Namely, on\nthe two closely related areas of **spectroscopy** and *imaging*.\nSpectroscopy is the processes by which matter is bombarded with some\ntype of particle or radiation, and the particles that are scattered,\ntransmitted, or re-emitted are analyzed for clues about the structure.\nImaging techniques use a similar paradigm, but the end goal is not to\nproduce a quantitative spectrum but a visual image for processing (often\nby the human brain). There are many modalities which combine\nspectroscopy and imaging in a single instrument. For a video primer to\nthis chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/N18UhNQmI8o)\n\nOne of the things that differentiates science from everyday rational\nbehavior is that science needs special tools to overcome the limits of\nhuman senses. We can only learn so much about the world from our senses\nof sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. While we can determine some\nthings about the structure and properties of matter from our five basic\nsenses, we need to correlate these observations to information gleaned\nfrom other tools. Nowhere is the augmentation of human senses more\nnecessary than in nanoengineering, where everything is way too small to\nsee with even the most powerful optical microscopes. For example, a\nnanoparticle or quantum dot might have a diameter of 5 nm, but the\nsmallest wavelength of light that can be detected by the human eye is\nabout 400 nm, which corresponds to violet light. So, we are blind to\nnanomaterials. That's why we can't see viruses billowing out of people's\nmouths and noses, and it's also why we can't see the intricate details\nof a computer microprocessor at the level of the transistor, even under\nthe highest possible magnification with a conventional microscope.\n\nThus, there is a conundrum posed by the diffraction limit of light. The\nway to circumvent this problem is to use particles other than visible\nphotons, such as electrons, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, or even helium\nnuclei. These approaches are analogous to optical microscopy in that\nthey use wavelike particles to interact with matter, and the image is\ncreated from the ways in which light is absorbed or scattered from the\nsurface.\n\nSuch methods of obtaining images of nanoscale objects are not limited\nonly to modalities which shine---or blast---light or particles upon the\nsample. The other major way in which information is collected about the\ncomposition and structure of nanoscale materials is not by shining a\nbeam from a distance, but rather by physical contact or near-physical\ncontact, in methods that are akin not to the sense of vision but to the\nsense of touch. Such approaches are referred to collectively as\n\"scanning probe\" techniques. The feature that all scanning probe\ninstruments have in common is the use of a sharp object which scans\nalong a surface (like a vinyl or LP player). The tip can be used to plot\nthe topography, mechanical properties, conductivity, chemical\ncomposition, or other properties of the surface. Finally, there are\ntechniques which use radiation not to generate images, but to probe the\nstructure of atoms, molecules, particles, and surfaces. These\nspectroscopic modalities rely on the basic physics we have covered in\ndetail in Chapter 8, so we will begin here.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Spectroscopic characterization of nanomaterials\nAs we discussed in Chapter 8 on light-matter interactions, the\nconfinement of electrons in a nanomaterial gives rise to properties that\nare related not only to the composition of the particle but to its\nphysical dimensions. Thus, it is possible to detect light that is\nscattered, absorbed and scattered, or absorbed and re-emitted by the\nprocess of fluorescence or phosphorescence. Alternatively, interrogation\nwith a high-energy beam of *something* triggers the ejection of some\nother type of particle or radiation. The key insight in spectroscopy is\nthat the energies of these ejected or scattered waves or particles\ncorrespond in a very specific way to the atoms, molecules, or materials\nunder interrogation.\n\nWhen taking spectra from particles in solution, where solvent and solute\nare totally mixed up, you get a single spectrum containing information\nfrom everything in solution. However, when dealing with solid samples,\nit is possible to obtain spectra from one region of the solid at a time.\nSuch spectra can be used to generate an image by plotting the spatially\nresolved intensity of one or more signals. Such an image can be used on\nits own or overlayed on top of an image using more conventional\ntechniques. This modality gives you information about the composition of\nthe structure and also the location of different atoms or bonding\narrangements between atoms in an image, and hence within an object. For\nexample, granite is an igneous rock composed of many different mineral\ntypes. Putting a sample of granite in an electron microscope equipped\nwith an X-ray detector allows you to distinguish the location of the\nminerals that make it up.\n\n### 14.2.1. Nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR\n\nSubatomic particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons have a\nproperty known as spin. Remember from high school chemistry, you drew\n\"up\" and \"down\" arrows when populating atomic orbitals with pairs of\nelectrons (one up, one down)? That notation was supposed to represent\n**spin**. It is a property that allows twice as many electrons to occupy\nthe same orbital without creating huge repulsive forces by the Pauli\nexclusion principle.[^14.2.1] You may remember that when constructing the\norbital energies like 1$s^2$, 2$s^2$, 2$p^6$, and so on, the electrons\nare paired antiparallel in their respective orbitals or energy levels.\nWhen spins are unpaired, the particle exhibits magnetic activity.\n\nThe concept of spin extends to other subatomic particles as well. For\nexample, when the nucleus of an atom has an odd number of protons and\nneutrons---e.g., $^1$H or $^{13}$C---the nucleus itself can be oriented\nin a magnetic field. In fact, it can be thought of as a little bar\nmagnet with a north and south pole. This magnetically active arrangement\ncan be exploited to learn something about the chemical environment of\nthe atom.\n\nThe technique for molecular structure determination by exploiting this\ninherent magnetism of odd-numbered nuclei is called **nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR)**. In NMR, a dilute solution of a molecule of interest\nis placed inside a strong electromagnet cooled by liquid helium. This\nelectromagnet aligns all of the magnetic moments in a single direction.\nOnce aligned, a radio-frequency electromagnetic pulse can be applied.\nSome of this radiation is absorbed by the nuclei, which flips the spin\nfrom one orientation to another. As the magnetic moment goes back into\nalignment with the field, some energy is released in the form of EM\nradiation. This radio-frequency energy is transformed into a spectrum.\nThe spectrum that is produced gives information on the electromagnetic\nenvironment of the magnetically active nuclei. For example, a hydrogen\natom, which has a total spin of one half because it has an odd number of\nnucleons (i.e., a single proton), will resonate at a different frequency\ndepending on its chemical environment. In fact, $^1$HNMR is by far the\nmost useful and popular kind of NMR spectroscopy. For many organic\nmolecules, it is not necessary to use any other spectroscopic technique\nto discern the structure.\n\n$^1H$NMR derives its usefulness from the fact that every hydrogen atom\nhas a different resonant energy depending on the density of electrons\nsurrounding it. Thus, it is usually possible to piece together the\nentire structure based on the precise energy of every hydrogen atom in\nthe molecule. Moreover, the **chemical shift** of the hydrogen atom is\npredictable based on a handful of simple rules. For example, if the\nhydrogen atom is attached to an electronegative element like oxygen, the\nsignal will be *de-shielded* by a predictable amount; if the hydrogen\natom is connected to an electropositive element like silicon, the\nresulting signal is said to be *shielded*, also by a predictable amount.\nShielded and de-shielded atoms nuclei can be easily resolved by NMR\nspectroscopy, with the resolution increasing with the strength of the\nmagnetic field. The strength of the signal (the area under the curve, or\nthe *integral*) also corresponds to how many atoms of a particular type\nare within a molecule.\n\nTo convert from the standard output of NMR software, where the signals\nare given in parts per million (ppm) to frequency of the emitted signal\n(and equivalently, energy), one uses the following formulae, equations\n(14.1) and (14.2)\n\n(Equation 14.1)\n$$\\delta_{\\text{Hz}} = \\delta_{\\text{ppm}} \\times \\text{frequency}_{\\text{MHz}}$$\n\n(Equation 14.2) $$E = h \\times \\nu$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{\\text{Hz}}$ is the chemical shift in Hz,\n$\\delta_{\\text{ppm}}$ is the chemical shift in ppm,\n$\\text{frequency}_{\\text{MHz}}$ is the operating frequency of the NMR\nspectrometer in MHz, $E$ is energy $h$ is Planck's constant, and $\\nu$\nis frequency in Hz.\n\nThe NMR spectrum can also give information as to the mutual arrangement\nor location of atoms attached to molecules at different points. They do\nthis by *through bond* or *through space* **coupling**. There are many\nexcellent references on the collection and interpretation of NMR spectra\nand we will not go into here. See Figure (14.1) below for a couple of\nexamples of molecules matched to spectra.\n\n(Figure 14.1) \n>>>image(NMR.png.0)\n\n### 14.2.2. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, UV-vis\n\nOne of the most common forms of spectroscopy involves the use of\nultraviolet and visible wavelengths of light to probe electronic\ntransitions in the molecules or particles. Photons in the UV-vis range\ntend to have energies commensurate with the band gaps of molecules,\nparticles, and surfaces. That is, absorption of photons that correspond\nto the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction\nband (when talking about inorganic materials) or from the highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular\norbital (LUMO) (when talking about molecules). Given that the energies\nof photons absorbed correspond to the transitions of electrons between\nenergy levels, UV-vis spectroscopy is often called **electronic\nabsorption spectroscopy**. Figure (14.2) shows the key features of a\nUV-vis spectrum.\n\n(Figure 14.2) \n>>>image(UV-vis.png.0)\n\nThe UV-vis spectrum is usually plotted with absorption on the $y$-axis\nas a function of either wavelength (in nm) or energy (in eV). The\nconvention used weirdly depends on who is plotting the data: chemists,\nbiologists, and some engineers tend to plot the absorption as a function\nof wavelength, while physicists and other engineers plot it as a\nfunction of energy. Since wavelength is inversely proportional to\nenergy, the plots appear as mirror images of each other.[^14.2.2] Note that\nwhile the differences between energy levels correspond to discrete\nphoton energies, the absorption spectra nevertheless appear as smoothed\nout curves, rather than lines. The broadening of the spectrum arises\nfirst from the *density of states* below the valence band and above the\nconduction band. Other effects that lead to broadening involve\nperturbations of the energy levels caused by molecular collisions with\neach other and with solvent molecules, formation of energy levels\nspanning multiple molecules from supramolecular organization (e.g.,\ncrystallization), and fluctuations of the energetic levels due to\nelectrostatic (e.g., van der Waals) forces. Despite the broadness of the\nabsorption profile, it is common practice to take the onset of\nabsorption as corresponding to the lowest energy photon absorbable by\nthe system and thus equivalent to the band gap. Usually, one takes the\nslope tangent to the beginning of the curve and extrapolates toward the\n$x$-axis, as shown in Figure (14.2). The $x$-intercept is taken as the\nband gap.\n\nUV-vis spectroscopy can be used to measure effects beyond the bandgaps\nof molecules and semiconductors. For example, the localized surface\nplasmon resonances (LSPRs) of metallic nanoparticles often also lie in\nthe ultraviolet or visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. When\nplaced in solution, colloidal metallic nanoparticles such as nanowires,\nnanocubes, and nanospheres absorb and scatter wavelengths of light that\ndepend on the shape of the nanoparticle and the atoms(s) of which it is\ncomposed. Recall that anisotropic nanoparticles like wires will have\nmultiple LSPRs, one for each dimension (a spherical or cubic particle\nwould have only a single resonance). The smaller dimensions will\nresonate at higher energies than the larger ones. Thus, in solution,\nwhere the particles are spinning and tumbling around randomly, all of\nthe LSPRs will be visible at once. However, if one deposits such\nstructures on glass or silicon using shearing forces during the\ndeposition, it is possible to get the particles to line up. Such\ndeposited structures will exhibit **birefringence**---in which polarized\nlight will trigger the LSPRs unequally. By using light with different\npolarizations, it is possible to tease out the energies of the LSPRs\nalong the different axes (Figure (14.3)).\n\n(Figure 14.3) \n>>>image(LSPR.png.0)\n\nFinally, we note that such absorption behavior arising from electronic\ntransitions and LSPRs are not strictly limited to the range of photons\nin the UV-vis region. In fact, many kinds of semiconductor nanocrystals\nabsorb in the near-infraried (NIR), and plasmonic nanoparticles with\ndimensions of more than a few hundred nanometers also resonate in this\nrange. Thus, the technique is often referred to as UV-vis-NIR.\n\n### 14.2.3. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, XPS\n\nWe have seen above how photons can affect transitions of electrons from\none band to another within a solid. However, with high enough incident\nenergies of photons, electrons can be completely ejected from the\nsurface of a material. This phenomenon is called the **photoelectric\neffect** (Figure (14.4) and was the basis of Albert Einstein's sole\nNobel Prize.[^14.2.3] In this theory, the kinetic energy of an electron\nejected from the surface of a solid is given by\n\n(Equation 14.3) $$E = h\\nu - \\phi$$\n\n(Figure 14.4) \n>>>image(photoelectric.png.0)\n\nwhere $E$ is the energy (kinetic energy, because the electron is\nmoving), $h$ and $\\nu$ are Planck's constant and the frequency of the\nincoming photon, and $\\phi$ is the **work function** of the surface. The\nwork function is conceptually similar to the **ionization energy**.\nHowever, the ionization energy refers to the energy required to extract\nthe outermost electron from an atom in the gas phase, whereas the work\nfunction is the energy required to extract an electron from the surface\nof a material made of many atoms. The work function is always less than\nthe ionization energy for individual atoms of the same element. In part,\nthis difference arises because of the strong electrostatic attraction of\nan electron to an ion in the gas phase; in a solid, the positive charge\nleft behind can more or less freely delocalize. Moreover, for an atom in\nthe gas phase, the ionization energy is taken as the energy of an\nelectron in the outermost (highest energy) occupied orbital. In a solid\nmetal, the outermost electrons are involved in strong metallic bonding.\nIn metallic solids, the energy of the outermost electrons is increased\nto a value called the **Fermi level**, which represents the average\nenergy of the conduction electrons. The Fermi level is sometimes called\nthe *electrochemical potential* of the electrons.\n\nWhen a photon of an energy equal to or greater than the Fermi level of\nthe metal surface, an electron is ejected. The finding illustrates one\naspect of the nature of light, namely the relationship between energy\nand intensity. Among other observations, Einstein noted that increasing\nthe brightness or intensity of the light does not increase the energy of\nthe ejected **photoelectrons**, but it does increase their number. This\ninsight into the energies of photoelectrons---namely that they are\nquantized and always have the same energies---is the basis for elemental\nanalysis by a technique called **X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\n(XPS)**.\n\nIn the traditional conception of measurements of the photoelectric\neffect, the incident beam is in the ultraviolet or visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Photons with wavelengths in this range can\nknock loose electrons in the highest energy atomic orbitals, or at the\nFermi level of the metal. However, if a beam made of much higher energy\nphotons is used, such as a beam of X-rays, it is possible to penetrate\nmuch deeper into the atomic structures. In XPS, a high-energy beam of\nphotons (X-rays, $\\lambda$ = 0.834 nm, E = 1486 eV, from an aluminum\nsource) blasts the surface of the sample. The collisions cause many\nelectrons to be ejected. These electrons can originate from any\nelectronic energy level within the atom. Recall from your chemistry\nclass that these energy levels correspond to the levels of 1s, 2s, 3p,\nand so on. The further inside the atom, toward the nucleus, the more\ntightly held the electron, and thus the greater energy needed to eject\nit. However, once the electron is ejected, it arrives at a detector with\n*less* energy than those which were on the outside---i.e., higher\nenergy---of the atom. The reason is that it took a lot of energy to\ndislodge the electron from the inner core, as implied by equation\n(14.3).\n\nGiven that every atom of any element has exactly the same energies for\nelectrons, the energies of the electrons ejected create a spectrum akin\nto a fingerprint. Thus, it is possible to determine the elemental\ncomposition of a material, at least near the surface. (The technique\nworks for the first 10 atomic layers or so.) See Figure (14.5) for an\nillustration of a typical XPS spectrum.\n\n(Figure 14.5) \n>>>image(XPS.png.0)\n\n### 14.2.4. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n\nA related technique to XPS is **energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS)**. The major difference, at least operationally, is that in XPS\nthe incident beam is an X-ray and the emitted beam is made of electrons;\nin EDS, the incident beam is an electron beam whereas the emitted beam\nis X-ray photons. In brief, an energetic beam of electrons strikes the\natoms that make up a material, see Figure (14.5). These energetic\ncollisions knock inner-shell electrons into free space. So far, EDS\nsounds a lot like XPS. However, it is not the ejected electrons are\ndetected, but rather *the photons released when outer-shell electrons\nfill in the holes left by ejected inner-shell electrons*. These photons\nare generally in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. As in\nXPS, the spectrum of energies produced creates a pattern unique to each\natom, like a fingerprint.\n\nThe EDS process is generally performed inside of a scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM, described in detail in the next section). The beam\nscanned across the sample to generate the image also triggers the\nproduction of X-rays. Thus, the SEM equipped with an X-ray detector can\nsimultaneously perform the imaging and the elemental analysis. It is\nthus possible to overlay an elemental map on top of an electron\nmicrograph (image). In this type of composite image, different elements\nare indicated using different colors. Electron microscopy plus EDS\nanalysis is a powerful tool to examine nanomaterials and the nanoscale\nstructures of larger samples.\n\n[^14.2.1]: Which says that particles having all the same properties cannot\n    occupy exactly the same space---they *exclude* each other.\n\n[^14.2.2]: Recall that one can convert between wavelength and energy using\n    the conversion factor of 1240 eV nm. Simply take the quantity you\n    have and divide it into the conversion factor to obtain the other\n    quantity. Thus a photon with an energy of 2 eV has a wavelength of\n    620 nm, and vice versa.\n\n[^14.2.3]: Despite possibly more important---and unquestionably deeper---work\n    in the realm of relativity theory.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Invisible worlds\nMaterials and phenomena that occur on the nanoscale are, almost by\ndefinition, too small for the human visual sense. Nevertheless, we\nreally do know their shapes, sizes, and compositions. To obtain this\ninformation, we rely on techniques of **characterization**. Namely, on\nthe two closely related areas of **spectroscopy** and *imaging*.\nSpectroscopy is the processes by which matter is bombarded with some\ntype of particle or radiation, and the particles that are scattered,\ntransmitted, or re-emitted are analyzed for clues about the structure.\nImaging techniques use a similar paradigm, but the end goal is not to\nproduce a quantitative spectrum but a visual image for processing (often\nby the human brain). There are many modalities which combine\nspectroscopy and imaging in a single instrument. For a video primer to\nthis chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/N18UhNQmI8o)\n\nOne of the things that differentiates science from everyday rational\nbehavior is that science needs special tools to overcome the limits of\nhuman senses. We can only learn so much about the world from our senses\nof sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste. While we can determine some\nthings about the structure and properties of matter from our five basic\nsenses, we need to correlate these observations to information gleaned\nfrom other tools. Nowhere is the augmentation of human senses more\nnecessary than in nanoengineering, where everything is way too small to\nsee with even the most powerful optical microscopes. For example, a\nnanoparticle or quantum dot might have a diameter of 5 nm, but the\nsmallest wavelength of light that can be detected by the human eye is\nabout 400 nm, which corresponds to violet light. So, we are blind to\nnanomaterials. That's why we can't see viruses billowing out of people's\nmouths and noses, and it's also why we can't see the intricate details\nof a computer microprocessor at the level of the transistor, even under\nthe highest possible magnification with a conventional microscope.\n\nThus, there is a conundrum posed by the diffraction limit of light. The\nway to circumvent this problem is to use particles other than visible\nphotons, such as electrons, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, or even helium\nnuclei. These approaches are analogous to optical microscopy in that\nthey use wavelike particles to interact with matter, and the image is\ncreated from the ways in which light is absorbed or scattered from the\nsurface.\n\nSuch methods of obtaining images of nanoscale objects are not limited\nonly to modalities which shine---or blast---light or particles upon the\nsample. The other major way in which information is collected about the\ncomposition and structure of nanoscale materials is not by shining a\nbeam from a distance, but rather by physical contact or near-physical\ncontact, in methods that are akin not to the sense of vision but to the\nsense of touch. Such approaches are referred to collectively as\n\"scanning probe\" techniques. The feature that all scanning probe\ninstruments have in common is the use of a sharp object which scans\nalong a surface (like a vinyl or LP player). The tip can be used to plot\nthe topography, mechanical properties, conductivity, chemical\ncomposition, or other properties of the surface. Finally, there are\ntechniques which use radiation not to generate images, but to probe the\nstructure of atoms, molecules, particles, and surfaces. These\nspectroscopic modalities rely on the basic physics we have covered in\ndetail in Chapter 8, so we will begin here.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Spectroscopic characterization of nanomaterials\nAs we discussed in Chapter 8 on light-matter interactions, the\nconfinement of electrons in a nanomaterial gives rise to properties that\nare related not only to the composition of the particle but to its\nphysical dimensions. Thus, it is possible to detect light that is\nscattered, absorbed and scattered, or absorbed and re-emitted by the\nprocess of fluorescence or phosphorescence. Alternatively, interrogation\nwith a high-energy beam of *something* triggers the ejection of some\nother type of particle or radiation. The key insight in spectroscopy is\nthat the energies of these ejected or scattered waves or particles\ncorrespond in a very specific way to the atoms, molecules, or materials\nunder interrogation.\n\nWhen taking spectra from particles in solution, where solvent and solute\nare totally mixed up, you get a single spectrum containing information\nfrom everything in solution. However, when dealing with solid samples,\nit is possible to obtain spectra from one region of the solid at a time.\nSuch spectra can be used to generate an image by plotting the spatially\nresolved intensity of one or more signals. Such an image can be used on\nits own or overlayed on top of an image using more conventional\ntechniques. This modality gives you information about the composition of\nthe structure and also the location of different atoms or bonding\narrangements between atoms in an image, and hence within an object. For\nexample, granite is an igneous rock composed of many different mineral\ntypes. Putting a sample of granite in an electron microscope equipped\nwith an X-ray detector allows you to distinguish the location of the\nminerals that make it up.\n\n### 14.2.1. Nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR\n\nSubatomic particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons have a\nproperty known as spin. Remember from high school chemistry, you drew\n\"up\" and \"down\" arrows when populating atomic orbitals with pairs of\nelectrons (one up, one down)? That notation was supposed to represent\n**spin**. It is a property that allows twice as many electrons to occupy\nthe same orbital without creating huge repulsive forces by the Pauli\nexclusion principle.[^14.2.1] You may remember that when constructing the\norbital energies like 1$s^2$, 2$s^2$, 2$p^6$, and so on, the electrons\nare paired antiparallel in their respective orbitals or energy levels.\nWhen spins are unpaired, the particle exhibits magnetic activity.\n\nThe concept of spin extends to other subatomic particles as well. For\nexample, when the nucleus of an atom has an odd number of protons and\nneutrons---e.g., $^1$H or $^{13}$C---the nucleus itself can be oriented\nin a magnetic field. In fact, it can be thought of as a little bar\nmagnet with a north and south pole. This magnetically active arrangement\ncan be exploited to learn something about the chemical environment of\nthe atom.\n\nThe technique for molecular structure determination by exploiting this\ninherent magnetism of odd-numbered nuclei is called **nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR)**. In NMR, a dilute solution of a molecule of interest\nis placed inside a strong electromagnet cooled by liquid helium. This\nelectromagnet aligns all of the magnetic moments in a single direction.\nOnce aligned, a radio-frequency electromagnetic pulse can be applied.\nSome of this radiation is absorbed by the nuclei, which flips the spin\nfrom one orientation to another. As the magnetic moment goes back into\nalignment with the field, some energy is released in the form of EM\nradiation. This radio-frequency energy is transformed into a spectrum.\nThe spectrum that is produced gives information on the electromagnetic\nenvironment of the magnetically active nuclei. For example, a hydrogen\natom, which has a total spin of one half because it has an odd number of\nnucleons (i.e., a single proton), will resonate at a different frequency\ndepending on its chemical environment. In fact, $^1$HNMR is by far the\nmost useful and popular kind of NMR spectroscopy. For many organic\nmolecules, it is not necessary to use any other spectroscopic technique\nto discern the structure.\n\n$^1H$NMR derives its usefulness from the fact that every hydrogen atom\nhas a different resonant energy depending on the density of electrons\nsurrounding it. Thus, it is usually possible to piece together the\nentire structure based on the precise energy of every hydrogen atom in\nthe molecule. Moreover, the **chemical shift** of the hydrogen atom is\npredictable based on a handful of simple rules. For example, if the\nhydrogen atom is attached to an electronegative element like oxygen, the\nsignal will be *de-shielded* by a predictable amount; if the hydrogen\natom is connected to an electropositive element like silicon, the\nresulting signal is said to be *shielded*, also by a predictable amount.\nShielded and de-shielded atoms nuclei can be easily resolved by NMR\nspectroscopy, with the resolution increasing with the strength of the\nmagnetic field. The strength of the signal (the area under the curve, or\nthe *integral*) also corresponds to how many atoms of a particular type\nare within a molecule.\n\nTo convert from the standard output of NMR software, where the signals\nare given in parts per million (ppm) to frequency of the emitted signal\n(and equivalently, energy), one uses the following formulae, equations\n(14.1) and (14.2)\n\n(Equation 14.1)\n$$\\delta_{\\text{Hz}} = \\delta_{\\text{ppm}} \\times \\text{frequency}_{\\text{MHz}}$$\n\n(Equation 14.2) $$E = h \\times \\nu$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{\\text{Hz}}$ is the chemical shift in Hz,\n$\\delta_{\\text{ppm}}$ is the chemical shift in ppm,\n$\\text{frequency}_{\\text{MHz}}$ is the operating frequency of the NMR\nspectrometer in MHz, $E$ is energy $h$ is Planck's constant, and $\\nu$\nis frequency in Hz.\n\nThe NMR spectrum can also give information as to the mutual arrangement\nor location of atoms attached to molecules at different points. They do\nthis by *through bond* or *through space* **coupling**. There are many\nexcellent references on the collection and interpretation of NMR spectra\nand we will not go into here. See Figure (14.1) below for a couple of\nexamples of molecules matched to spectra.\n\n(Figure 14.1) \n>>>image(NMR.png.0)\n\n### 14.2.2. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, UV-vis\n\nOne of the most common forms of spectroscopy involves the use of\nultraviolet and visible wavelengths of light to probe electronic\ntransitions in the molecules or particles. Photons in the UV-vis range\ntend to have energies commensurate with the band gaps of molecules,\nparticles, and surfaces. That is, absorption of photons that correspond\nto the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction\nband (when talking about inorganic materials) or from the highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular\norbital (LUMO) (when talking about molecules). Given that the energies\nof photons absorbed correspond to the transitions of electrons between\nenergy levels, UV-vis spectroscopy is often called **electronic\nabsorption spectroscopy**. Figure (14.2) shows the key features of a\nUV-vis spectrum.\n\n(Figure 14.2) \n>>>image(UV-vis.png.0)\n\nThe UV-vis spectrum is usually plotted with absorption on the $y$-axis\nas a function of either wavelength (in nm) or energy (in eV). The\nconvention used weirdly depends on who is plotting the data: chemists,\nbiologists, and some engineers tend to plot the absorption as a function\nof wavelength, while physicists and other engineers plot it as a\nfunction of energy. Since wavelength is inversely proportional to\nenergy, the plots appear as mirror images of each other.[^14.2.2] Note that\nwhile the differences between energy levels correspond to discrete\nphoton energies, the absorption spectra nevertheless appear as smoothed\nout curves, rather than lines. The broadening of the spectrum arises\nfirst from the *density of states* below the valence band and above the\nconduction band. Other effects that lead to broadening involve\nperturbations of the energy levels caused by molecular collisions with\neach other and with solvent molecules, formation of energy levels\nspanning multiple molecules from supramolecular organization (e.g.,\ncrystallization), and fluctuations of the energetic levels due to\nelectrostatic (e.g., van der Waals) forces. Despite the broadness of the\nabsorption profile, it is common practice to take the onset of\nabsorption as corresponding to the lowest energy photon absorbable by\nthe system and thus equivalent to the band gap. Usually, one takes the\nslope tangent to the beginning of the curve and extrapolates toward the\n$x$-axis, as shown in Figure (14.2). The $x$-intercept is taken as the\nband gap.\n\nUV-vis spectroscopy can be used to measure effects beyond the bandgaps\nof molecules and semiconductors. For example, the localized surface\nplasmon resonances (LSPRs) of metallic nanoparticles often also lie in\nthe ultraviolet or visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. When\nplaced in solution, colloidal metallic nanoparticles such as nanowires,\nnanocubes, and nanospheres absorb and scatter wavelengths of light that\ndepend on the shape of the nanoparticle and the atoms(s) of which it is\ncomposed. Recall that anisotropic nanoparticles like wires will have\nmultiple LSPRs, one for each dimension (a spherical or cubic particle\nwould have only a single resonance). The smaller dimensions will\nresonate at higher energies than the larger ones. Thus, in solution,\nwhere the particles are spinning and tumbling around randomly, all of\nthe LSPRs will be visible at once. However, if one deposits such\nstructures on glass or silicon using shearing forces during the\ndeposition, it is possible to get the particles to line up. Such\ndeposited structures will exhibit **birefringence**---in which polarized\nlight will trigger the LSPRs unequally. By using light with different\npolarizations, it is possible to tease out the energies of the LSPRs\nalong the different axes (Figure (14.3)).\n\n(Figure 14.3) \n>>>image(LSPR.png.0)\n\nFinally, we note that such absorption behavior arising from electronic\ntransitions and LSPRs are not strictly limited to the range of photons\nin the UV-vis region. In fact, many kinds of semiconductor nanocrystals\nabsorb in the near-infraried (NIR), and plasmonic nanoparticles with\ndimensions of more than a few hundred nanometers also resonate in this\nrange. Thus, the technique is often referred to as UV-vis-NIR.\n\n### 14.2.3. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, XPS\n\nWe have seen above how photons can affect transitions of electrons from\none band to another within a solid. However, with high enough incident\nenergies of photons, electrons can be completely ejected from the\nsurface of a material. This phenomenon is called the **photoelectric\neffect** (Figure (14.4) and was the basis of Albert Einstein's sole\nNobel Prize.[^14.2.3] In this theory, the kinetic energy of an electron\nejected from the surface of a solid is given by\n\n(Equation 14.3) $$E = h\\nu - \\phi$$\n\n(Figure 14.4) \n>>>image(photoelectric.png.0)\n\nwhere $E$ is the energy (kinetic energy, because the electron is\nmoving), $h$ and $\\nu$ are Planck's constant and the frequency of the\nincoming photon, and $\\phi$ is the **work function** of the surface. The\nwork function is conceptually similar to the **ionization energy**.\nHowever, the ionization energy refers to the energy required to extract\nthe outermost electron from an atom in the gas phase, whereas the work\nfunction is the energy required to extract an electron from the surface\nof a material made of many atoms. The work function is always less than\nthe ionization energy for individual atoms of the same element. In part,\nthis difference arises because of the strong electrostatic attraction of\nan electron to an ion in the gas phase; in a solid, the positive charge\nleft behind can more or less freely delocalize. Moreover, for an atom in\nthe gas phase, the ionization energy is taken as the energy of an\nelectron in the outermost (highest energy) occupied orbital. In a solid\nmetal, the outermost electrons are involved in strong metallic bonding.\nIn metallic solids, the energy of the outermost electrons is increased\nto a value called the **Fermi level**, which represents the average\nenergy of the conduction electrons. The Fermi level is sometimes called\nthe *electrochemical potential* of the electrons.\n\nWhen a photon of an energy equal to or greater than the Fermi level of\nthe metal surface, an electron is ejected. The finding illustrates one\naspect of the nature of light, namely the relationship between energy\nand intensity. Among other observations, Einstein noted that increasing\nthe brightness or intensity of the light does not increase the energy of\nthe ejected **photoelectrons**, but it does increase their number. This\ninsight into the energies of photoelectrons---namely that they are\nquantized and always have the same energies---is the basis for elemental\nanalysis by a technique called **X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\n(XPS)**.\n\nIn the traditional conception of measurements of the photoelectric\neffect, the incident beam is in the ultraviolet or visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Photons with wavelengths in this range can\nknock loose electrons in the highest energy atomic orbitals, or at the\nFermi level of the metal. However, if a beam made of much higher energy\nphotons is used, such as a beam of X-rays, it is possible to penetrate\nmuch deeper into the atomic structures. In XPS, a high-energy beam of\nphotons (X-rays, $\\lambda$ = 0.834 nm, E = 1486 eV, from an aluminum\nsource) blasts the surface of the sample. The collisions cause many\nelectrons to be ejected. These electrons can originate from any\nelectronic energy level within the atom. Recall from your chemistry\nclass that these energy levels correspond to the levels of 1s, 2s, 3p,\nand so on. The further inside the atom, toward the nucleus, the more\ntightly held the electron, and thus the greater energy needed to eject\nit. However, once the electron is ejected, it arrives at a detector with\n*less* energy than those which were on the outside---i.e., higher\nenergy---of the atom. The reason is that it took a lot of energy to\ndislodge the electron from the inner core, as implied by equation\n(14.3).\n\nGiven that every atom of any element has exactly the same energies for\nelectrons, the energies of the electrons ejected create a spectrum akin\nto a fingerprint. Thus, it is possible to determine the elemental\ncomposition of a material, at least near the surface. (The technique\nworks for the first 10 atomic layers or so.) See Figure (14.5) for an\nillustration of a typical XPS spectrum.\n\n(Figure 14.5) \n>>>image(XPS.png.0)\n\n### 14.2.4. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n\nA related technique to XPS is **energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS)**. The major difference, at least operationally, is that in XPS\nthe incident beam is an X-ray and the emitted beam is made of electrons;\nin EDS, the incident beam is an electron beam whereas the emitted beam\nis X-ray photons. In brief, an energetic beam of electrons strikes the\natoms that make up a material, see Figure (14.5). These energetic\ncollisions knock inner-shell electrons into free space. So far, EDS\nsounds a lot like XPS. However, it is not the ejected electrons are\ndetected, but rather *the photons released when outer-shell electrons\nfill in the holes left by ejected inner-shell electrons*. These photons\nare generally in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. As in\nXPS, the spectrum of energies produced creates a pattern unique to each\natom, like a fingerprint.\n\nThe EDS process is generally performed inside of a scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM, described in detail in the next section). The beam\nscanned across the sample to generate the image also triggers the\nproduction of X-rays. Thus, the SEM equipped with an X-ray detector can\nsimultaneously perform the imaging and the elemental analysis. It is\nthus possible to overlay an elemental map on top of an electron\nmicrograph (image). In this type of composite image, different elements\nare indicated using different colors. Electron microscopy plus EDS\nanalysis is a powerful tool to examine nanomaterials and the nanoscale\nstructures of larger samples.\n\n[^14.2.1]: Which says that particles having all the same properties cannot\n    occupy exactly the same space---they *exclude* each other.\n\n[^14.2.2]: Recall that one can convert between wavelength and energy using\n    the conversion factor of 1240 eV nm. Simply take the quantity you\n    have and divide it into the conversion factor to obtain the other\n    quantity. Thus a photon with an energy of 2 eV has a wavelength of\n    620 nm, and vice versa.\n\n[^14.2.3]: Despite possibly more important---and unquestionably deeper---work\n    in the realm of relativity theory.\n",
