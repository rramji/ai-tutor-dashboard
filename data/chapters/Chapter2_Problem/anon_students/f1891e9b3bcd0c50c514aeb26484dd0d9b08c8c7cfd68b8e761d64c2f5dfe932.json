In other words, the\\npKa of an acid is lower\u2014favoring dissociation into H+ and A- if A- is\\nrelatively stable as an anion. Using the concept of electrostatic\\npotential energy, how can this conception of the strength of acids be\\nused to rationalize the increase in acidity as one goes down the\\nhalides from top to bottom: F, Cl, Br, and I?'}",
