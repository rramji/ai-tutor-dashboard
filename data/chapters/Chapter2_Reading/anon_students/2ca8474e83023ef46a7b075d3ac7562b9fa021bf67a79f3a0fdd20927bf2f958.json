      "content": "#### Section 1: Energy and force\nThere are two types of forces that exist between individual atoms, ions,\nand molecules. The first type is based on the formal sharing of\nelectrons. That is, **covalent bonds**, which you learned all about in\nyour chemistry classes. The second type is based on **electrostatic\ninteractions**. That is, Coulombic interactions between objects with\nformal charges and partial charges in the form of dipoles. A subset of\nCoulombic interactions include the **van der Waals forces** arising from\ndipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and dispersion interactions. The\nimportance of such interactions in predicting the behavior of physical,\nchemical, and biological systems comes from the fact that they exist\nbetween all atoms, ions, and molecules at all times. While not all atoms\nare capable of forming covalent bonds with each other, *every* atom or\nmolecule experiences van der Waals interactions with every other atom or\nmolecule in its vicinity. From these interactions arise most of\nbiological function and much of the behavior of matter. For a video\nprimer to this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/CgazkHdBQmo)\n\nPhenomena that occur on the nanoscale arise from a few guiding\nprinciples. First off, just like the items in your once nicely organized\ndesk or bedroom, stuff likes to spread out. In physics, this tendency is\nsometimes due to entropy. That is, there are more ways of charges,\nparticles, and molecules to be spread out than there are for the same\nitems to be arranged neatly. Thus, the individual components of systems\ntend to adjust themselves such that they are spread out as much as\npossible. In the case of particles with the same charge (e.g., a bunch\nof negatively charged ions) spreading out is due to electrostatic\nrepulsion of like charges. In fact, even a solitary charge will\nexperience \"self repulsion\" and take up as much volume as possible.[^2.1.1]\nWhen particles and charges spread out, the potential energy is lower\nthan when the same species are confined. See Figure (2.1) for examples\nof systems with high and low potential energy.\n\n(Figure 2.1) \n>>>image(highlowpotential.png.0)\n\nDifferences in potential energies of states lead to physical forces\nwhich make change happen. These forces act to decrease the potential\nenergy of the system, from high potential energy to low potential\nenergy. (For example, the high gravitational potential energy of\nstanding at the top of a hill to the low potential energy of standing at\nthe base of the hill.) The potential energies of confined systems tend\nto be larger than those of relaxed systems. The higher energies\nassociated with confined systems lead to bigger driving forces for\nchange to occur. For example, there is comparatively a larger difference\nin the free energies of the products and reactants in a chemical\nreaction when one of the reactants is constrained somehow: picture a\nring-shaped molecule that \"wants\" to open up to form a linear chain (the\nreasons are both entropic and quantum mechanical). Or, consider the fact\nthat a small ion---whose charge is confined and uptight---has more to\ngain by associating with an ion of the opposite charge than does a large\nion---whose charge is spread out and relaxed. Finally, when particles\nsuch as electrons are confined to small spaces (e.g., in a **quantum\ndot**), larger energies (smaller wavelengths) of photons of light are\neither absorbed, emitted, or scattered. If this does not make sense\nnow---energy, entropy, absorption, emission, etc.---don't worry, our\ngoal by the end of this book is to make it make sense.\n\nIt's worth taking a closer look at what we mean by energy and force. In\nhigh school physics and chemistry, much is made of the distinction\nbetween potential energy and kinetic energy. You probably spent several\nweeks talking about kinematics of billiard balls, projectiles, and\nballistic trajectories. Indeed, kinetic energy is useful when discussing\nthe kinetic theory of gasses, along with **dissipative** processes such\nas friction.[^2.1.2] However, in nanoengineering and in the dynamics of\nmolecules and particles in solution, **potential energy** is a more\nuseful concept than kinetic energy. The reason is as we are more\ninterested in how a system came to be and how it might change, rather\nthan how fast its pieces are moving.\n\nThe potential energy of a system is equal to the work needed (positive\nwork) or done (negative work) to bring the system into existence, with\nall the components at defined locations. To deconstruct the system---to\ntake all of the atoms and molecules and separate them into\ninfinity---requires the same amount of energy, but with the opposite\nsign. When a system consisting of objects of any size have a lower\nenergy than all of the components considered separately, the system has\na **favorable** (i.e., negative) potential energy. Potential energy is\ndeeply connected to the concept of force. Force is the rate of change of\nthe potential energy with respect to some change in the system. It turns\nout that these seemingly abstract concepts control a vast range of\nnatural phenomena when applied on the nanoscale. For example, from\nproperties of substances such as the stickiness of glue and the cleaning\npower of soap, to basically all of chemistry and biology.\n\n### 2.1.1. Electrostatic interactions\n\nLet's make these broad statements more concrete: Say you have two\ncharged particles. They could be made of plastic, metal, or rock, or\neven single ions, like Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ separated by distance $r$,\nsee Figure (2.2).\n\n(Figure 2.2) \n>>>image(NaCl.png.0)\n\nAny time two objects---including atoms, ions, molecules, fingers,\nbuildings, or planets---are near each other, there is some kind of\npotential energy between them, or **interaction energy**, **interaction\npotential**, or **potential energy of interaction**. Think of the\ngravitational potential energy between you and the Earth when you are\nsomeplace high up, like on a diving board. On the diving board, your\npotential energy is high. On the ground, it is low. The potential energy\nbetween two particles---atoms, ions, and molecules---can be either high\nor low at a given separation depending on how the objects are charged.\nParticles with like charges (i.e., two negatives) have high potential\nenergy; those with unlike charges have lower potential energy. In either\ncase, the potential energy changes as the particles are brought closer\ntogether or farther apart.\n\nIf we are talking about small numbers of atoms, ions, and molecules, the\ndominant source of the potential energy is electrostatic. That is,\nopposite charges attract and like charges repel. Words like \"attract\"\nand \"repel\" refer to the **force** of the interaction. However, the\naccounting of the interaction on our balance sheet is done using the\n*energy*. The reason is that it is the energy, not the force, that must\nbe conserved in any process.[^2.1.3]\n\nIn this chapter and throughout the book, when we say energy, we are\nalmost always talking about the potential energy. To drive home the\npoint, in nanoscale interactions, we generally don't care that much\nabout kinetic energy. That is, the energy of movement. Exceptions are\nwhen we need to deal with effects that come from the motion of large\nnumbers of particles, like the pressure exerted by gasses and the forces\nof friction. In these cases, kinetic energy takes on an important role.\n\nThe potential energy of a generic interaction is given by\n\n$$w(r)=\\frac{C}{r^n}$$\n\nwhere $w(r)$ is the potential energy of interaction between two objects,\n$C$ is a constant that takes into account the properties of the two\ninteracting objects, $r$ is the separation between the centers of the\ntwo objects, and $n$ is an integer related to the type of interaction.\nFor electrostatic energy, $n=1$ and\n\n(Equation 2.1) $$C_{Coulomb's law}=\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nwhere the $Q$s are the charges ($-1 \\times e$ for Cl$^{-}$ and\n$+1 \\times e$ for Na$^+$), and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free\nspace. The constant $e$ is the **fundamental charge**, or the charge of\nan electron or proton.[^2.1.4] If one charge is negative and the other is\npositive, the overall potential energy is negative. It is useful to\nbreak the $Q$s down into two components, $z$ and $e$, where $z$ is the\n**valency**. For Na$^+$, $z=1$; for Ca$^{2+}$, $z=2$, and so on.[^2.1.5]\n\nWhat does it mean to have a negative potential energy? Before answering\nthe question, it is worth considering what the potential energy actually\nmeans. The potential energy is equivalent to the work done in order to\nbring the objects together. In this thought experiment, the particles\nare initially separated by infinite distance. In the case of two\noppositely charged particles, which in a sense \"want\" to interact, it\ntakes *negative* work. That is, the system kind of does the work for\nyou. To put two particles with the same charge in close proximity, it\nwould have taken some effort. That is, positive work.[^2.1.6]\n\nIt is sometimes thought that a negative potential energy between two\nobjects implies an attractive force. This simple assumption is often\ntrue, but not always. The more important criterion for determining the\ntype of force (attractive or repulsive) than the sign of the energy at a\nfixed separation is what happens to the energy when the particles get\ncloser together or further apart. That is, does the energy increase or\ndecrease? If the potential energy decreases when the objects come closer\ntogether, the force between the objects is attractive; if it increases,\nthe force is repulsive. So, the sign of the potential energy at a fixed\nseparation, $r$ (whether it is negative or positive) means nothing in\nterms of force. *What matters is the rate of change* of $w(r)$ with\nrespect to separation, $r$. This rate of change is equal to the force.\n\n(Equation 2.2) $$F(r) = -\\frac{dw(r)}{dr}$$\n\nWhere the $d$s refer to small incremental differences $(\\Delta$s) in\neither energy (numerator) or separation (denominator). We need to have\nthe negative sign out front to make sure that attractive interactions\nhave negative forces. Convince yourself by putting the sign of the\noverall force in the squares below (Table (2.1)).\n\nTable (2.1)\n\n|      | $w(r)$inc | $w(r)$dec |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| $r$inc |           |           |\n| $r$dec |           |           |\n\n  >Determine the sign of the force in the four blank squares\n\nNote that the convention that *negative force* implies *attractive\ninteraction* is arbitrary---just for convenience and consistency.\nNegative or decreasing quantities imply driving force or stability of a\nsystem relative to a **reference state**. A reference state is almost\nalways considered to be a system of particles that do not interact, as\nin when they are held at infinite distance. We close this section by\nsaying that the above arguments and equations are valid for all charged\nobjects of any size: from ions to charged plastic spheres.\n\n[^2.1.1]: This principle explains why the iodide ion, I$^-$, has a lower\n    potential energy than the much smaller fluoride ion, F$^-$\n\n[^2.1.2]: Dissipative means that an initially directed form of energy like a\n    foot stomp is transformed into a multitude of processes for which\n    it's more difficult to account: sound waves, microscopic damage to\n    your shoe sole and the floor, molecular motion, and heat.\n\n[^2.1.3]: A fundamental concern in all of engineering is to keep track of\n    where all the energy goes: inputs from fossil fuels, the sun, and\n    the wind, and outputs in the form of useful work. Less useful\n    outcomes like friction, heat, and sound waves, are often things to\n    be suppressed. Since these loss mechanisms have their origins in\n    processes that occur on the nanoscale and molecular scale (often at\n    the interfaces between unlike materials), reducing these sources of\n    energy loss are a huge opportunity for nanoengineers!\n\n[^2.1.4]: $e=1.6\\times10^{-19}$C, where the unit C is one Coulomb, or the\n    amount of charge that flows in a current of one Ampere over the\n    course of one second, A $\\times$ s.\n\n[^2.1.5]: The valency is also where the negative sign gets re-introduced.\n    For the ionic interaction between sodium and chloride, NaCl, $z_1=1$\n    and $z_2=-1$.\n\n[^2.1.6]: Potential energies are so important in chemistry and\n    nanoengineering, that when we say \"potential,\" \"potential function,\"\n    or even just \"energy,\" we are always talking about the potential\n    energy.\n",
