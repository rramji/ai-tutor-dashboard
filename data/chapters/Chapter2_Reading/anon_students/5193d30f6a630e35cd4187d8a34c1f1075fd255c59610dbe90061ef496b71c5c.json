      "content": "#### Section 1: Energy and force\nThere are two types of forces that exist between individual atoms, ions,\nand molecules. The first type is based on the formal sharing of\nelectrons. That is, **covalent bonds**, which you learned all about in\nyour chemistry classes. The second type is based on **electrostatic\ninteractions**. That is, Coulombic interactions between objects with\nformal charges and partial charges in the form of dipoles. A subset of\nCoulombic interactions include the **van der Waals forces** arising from\ndipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and dispersion interactions. The\nimportance of such interactions in predicting the behavior of physical,\nchemical, and biological systems comes from the fact that they exist\nbetween all atoms, ions, and molecules at all times. While not all atoms\nare capable of forming covalent bonds with each other, *every* atom or\nmolecule experiences van der Waals interactions with every other atom or\nmolecule in its vicinity. From these interactions arise most of\nbiological function and much of the behavior of matter. For a video\nprimer to this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/CgazkHdBQmo)\n\nPhenomena that occur on the nanoscale arise from a few guiding\nprinciples. First off, just like the items in your once nicely organized\ndesk or bedroom, stuff likes to spread out. In physics, this tendency is\nsometimes due to entropy. That is, there are more ways of charges,\nparticles, and molecules to be spread out than there are for the same\nitems to be arranged neatly. Thus, the individual components of systems\ntend to adjust themselves such that they are spread out as much as\npossible. In the case of particles with the same charge (e.g., a bunch\nof negatively charged ions) spreading out is due to electrostatic\nrepulsion of like charges. In fact, even a solitary charge will\nexperience \"self repulsion\" and take up as much volume as possible.[^2.1.1]\nWhen particles and charges spread out, the potential energy is lower\nthan when the same species are confined. See Figure (2.1) for examples\nof systems with high and low potential energy.\n\n(Figure 2.1) \n>>>image(highlowpotential.png.0)\n\nDifferences in potential energies of states lead to physical forces\nwhich make change happen. These forces act to decrease the potential\nenergy of the system, from high potential energy to low potential\nenergy. (For example, the high gravitational potential energy of\nstanding at the top of a hill to the low potential energy of standing at\nthe base of the hill.) The potential energies of confined systems tend\nto be larger than those of relaxed systems. The higher energies\nassociated with confined systems lead to bigger driving forces for\nchange to occur. For example, there is comparatively a larger difference\nin the free energies of the products and reactants in a chemical\nreaction when one of the reactants is constrained somehow: picture a\nring-shaped molecule that \"wants\" to open up to form a linear chain (the\nreasons are both entropic and quantum mechanical). Or, consider the fact\nthat a small ion---whose charge is confined and uptight---has more to\ngain by associating with an ion of the opposite charge than does a large\nion---whose charge is spread out and relaxed. Finally, when particles\nsuch as electrons are confined to small spaces (e.g., in a **quantum\ndot**), larger energies (smaller wavelengths) of photons of light are\neither absorbed, emitted, or scattered. If this does not make sense\nnow---energy, entropy, absorption, emission, etc.---don't worry, our\ngoal by the end of this book is to make it make sense.\n\nIt's worth taking a closer look at what we mean by energy and force. In\nhigh school physics and chemistry, much is made of the distinction\nbetween potential energy and kinetic energy. You probably spent several\nweeks talking about kinematics of billiard balls, projectiles, and\nballistic trajectories. Indeed, kinetic energy is useful when discussing\nthe kinetic theory of gasses, along with **dissipative** processes such\nas friction.[^2.1.2] However, in nanoengineering and in the dynamics of\nmolecules and particles in solution, **potential energy** is a more\nuseful concept than kinetic energy. The reason is as we are more\ninterested in how a system came to be and how it might change, rather\nthan how fast its pieces are moving.\n\nThe potential energy of a system is equal to the work needed (positive\nwork) or done (negative work) to bring the system into existence, with\nall the components at defined locations. To deconstruct the system---to\ntake all of the atoms and molecules and separate them into\ninfinity---requires the same amount of energy, but with the opposite\nsign. When a system consisting of objects of any size have a lower\nenergy than all of the components considered separately, the system has\na **favorable** (i.e., negative) potential energy. Potential energy is\ndeeply connected to the concept of force. Force is the rate of change of\nthe potential energy with respect to some change in the system. It turns\nout that these seemingly abstract concepts control a vast range of\nnatural phenomena when applied on the nanoscale. For example, from\nproperties of substances such as the stickiness of glue and the cleaning\npower of soap, to basically all of chemistry and biology.\n\n### 2.1.1. Electrostatic interactions\n\nLet's make these broad statements more concrete: Say you have two\ncharged particles. They could be made of plastic, metal, or rock, or\neven single ions, like Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ separated by distance $r$,\nsee Figure (2.2).\n\n(Figure 2.2) \n>>>image(NaCl.png.0)\n\nAny time two objects---including atoms, ions, molecules, fingers,\nbuildings, or planets---are near each other, there is some kind of\npotential energy between them, or **interaction energy**, **interaction\npotential**, or **potential energy of interaction**. Think of the\ngravitational potential energy between you and the Earth when you are\nsomeplace high up, like on a diving board. On the diving board, your\npotential energy is high. On the ground, it is low. The potential energy\nbetween two particles---atoms, ions, and molecules---can be either high\nor low at a given separation depending on how the objects are charged.\nParticles with like charges (i.e., two negatives) have high potential\nenergy; those with unlike charges have lower potential energy. In either\ncase, the potential energy changes as the particles are brought closer\ntogether or farther apart.\n\nIf we are talking about small numbers of atoms, ions, and molecules, the\ndominant source of the potential energy is electrostatic. That is,\nopposite charges attract and like charges repel. Words like \"attract\"\nand \"repel\" refer to the **force** of the interaction. However, the\naccounting of the interaction on our balance sheet is done using the\n*energy*. The reason is that it is the energy, not the force, that must\nbe conserved in any process.[^2.1.3]\n\nIn this chapter and throughout the book, when we say energy, we are\nalmost always talking about the potential energy. To drive home the\npoint, in nanoscale interactions, we generally don't care that much\nabout kinetic energy. That is, the energy of movement. Exceptions are\nwhen we need to deal with effects that come from the motion of large\nnumbers of particles, like the pressure exerted by gasses and the forces\nof friction. In these cases, kinetic energy takes on an important role.\n\nThe potential energy of a generic interaction is given by\n\n$$w(r)=\\frac{C}{r^n}$$\n\nwhere $w(r)$ is the potential energy of interaction between two objects,\n$C$ is a constant that takes into account the properties of the two\ninteracting objects, $r$ is the separation between the centers of the\ntwo objects, and $n$ is an integer related to the type of interaction.\nFor electrostatic energy, $n=1$ and\n\n(Equation 2.1) $$C_{Coulomb's law}=\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nwhere the $Q$s are the charges ($-1 \\times e$ for Cl$^{-}$ and\n$+1 \\times e$ for Na$^+$), and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free\nspace. The constant $e$ is the **fundamental charge**, or the charge of\nan electron or proton.[^2.1.4] If one charge is negative and the other is\npositive, the overall potential energy is negative. It is useful to\nbreak the $Q$s down into two components, $z$ and $e$, where $z$ is the\n**valency**. For Na$^+$, $z=1$; for Ca$^{2+}$, $z=2$, and so on.[^2.1.5]\n\nWhat does it mean to have a negative potential energy? Before answering\nthe question, it is worth considering what the potential energy actually\nmeans. The potential energy is equivalent to the work done in order to\nbring the objects together. In this thought experiment, the particles\nare initially separated by infinite distance. In the case of two\noppositely charged particles, which in a sense \"want\" to interact, it\ntakes *negative* work. That is, the system kind of does the work for\nyou. To put two particles with the same charge in close proximity, it\nwould have taken some effort. That is, positive work.[^2.1.6]\n\nIt is sometimes thought that a negative potential energy between two\nobjects implies an attractive force. This simple assumption is often\ntrue, but not always. The more important criterion for determining the\ntype of force (attractive or repulsive) than the sign of the energy at a\nfixed separation is what happens to the energy when the particles get\ncloser together or further apart. That is, does the energy increase or\ndecrease? If the potential energy decreases when the objects come closer\ntogether, the force between the objects is attractive; if it increases,\nthe force is repulsive. So, the sign of the potential energy at a fixed\nseparation, $r$ (whether it is negative or positive) means nothing in\nterms of force. *What matters is the rate of change* of $w(r)$ with\nrespect to separation, $r$. This rate of change is equal to the force.\n\n(Equation 2.2) $$F(r) = -\\frac{dw(r)}{dr}$$\n\nWhere the $d$s refer to small incremental differences $(\\Delta$s) in\neither energy (numerator) or separation (denominator). We need to have\nthe negative sign out front to make sure that attractive interactions\nhave negative forces. Convince yourself by putting the sign of the\noverall force in the squares below (Table (2.1)).\n\nTable (2.1)\n\n|      | $w(r)$inc | $w(r)$dec |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| $r$inc |           |           |\n| $r$dec |           |           |\n\n  >Determine the sign of the force in the four blank squares\n\nNote that the convention that *negative force* implies *attractive\ninteraction* is arbitrary---just for convenience and consistency.\nNegative or decreasing quantities imply driving force or stability of a\nsystem relative to a **reference state**. A reference state is almost\nalways considered to be a system of particles that do not interact, as\nin when they are held at infinite distance. We close this section by\nsaying that the above arguments and equations are valid for all charged\nobjects of any size: from ions to charged plastic spheres.\n\n[^2.1.1]: This principle explains why the iodide ion, I$^-$, has a lower\n    potential energy than the much smaller fluoride ion, F$^-$\n\n[^2.1.2]: Dissipative means that an initially directed form of energy like a\n    foot stomp is transformed into a multitude of processes for which\n    it's more difficult to account: sound waves, microscopic damage to\n    your shoe sole and the floor, molecular motion, and heat.\n\n[^2.1.3]: A fundamental concern in all of engineering is to keep track of\n    where all the energy goes: inputs from fossil fuels, the sun, and\n    the wind, and outputs in the form of useful work. Less useful\n    outcomes like friction, heat, and sound waves, are often things to\n    be suppressed. Since these loss mechanisms have their origins in\n    processes that occur on the nanoscale and molecular scale (often at\n    the interfaces between unlike materials), reducing these sources of\n    energy loss are a huge opportunity for nanoengineers!\n\n[^2.1.4]: $e=1.6\\times10^{-19}$C, where the unit C is one Coulomb, or the\n    amount of charge that flows in a current of one Ampere over the\n    course of one second, A $\\times$ s.\n\n[^2.1.5]: The valency is also where the negative sign gets re-introduced.\n    For the ionic interaction between sodium and chloride, NaCl, $z_1=1$\n    and $z_2=-1$.\n\n[^2.1.6]: Potential energies are so important in chemistry and\n    nanoengineering, that when we say \"potential,\" \"potential function,\"\n    or even just \"energy,\" we are always talking about the potential\n    energy.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Van der Waals interactions\nNot all objects are permanently charged like Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$. Even so,\nthere will still be an electrostatic interaction between objects, even\nif they are not charged! In fact, there usually is such an interaction,\neven between completely nonpolar molecules.[^2.2.1] This interaction arises\nbecause of the separation of charges in a neutral molecule or because of\ntransient (short-lived) shifting of the negatively charged electron\nclouds around the positively charged nuclei. The short-lived electrical\ndipoles that form as a result of this movement of the electron clouds is\ncalled **transient polarization**. The type of interaction that arises\nwhen uncharged (but still possibly dipolar) molecules get close to each\nother---the **van der Waals interaction**---has three separate\ncomponents that operate by similar principles. These three components\nare the **dipole-dipole** interaction (Keesom), the **dipole-induced\ndipole** interaction (Debye), and the **dispersion** interaction\n(London). The proper names in parentheses refer to the scientists who\nfirst described these forces. Sometimes these interactions are called\n\"forces,\" but I want to be clear that we are usually talking about\npotential energies, not forces. Saying that a nanoparticle interacts\nwith a cell in terms of kJ mol$^{-1}$ makes a lot more intuitive sense\nthan saying that it interacts by a nN (nano newton) or whatever. All\nthree components of the van der Waals interaction boil down to the\n**Coulomb interaction** between electrical dipoles. That is, the\npositively charged side of the first dipole is attracted to the negative\nside of the second dipole. However, each one of the components has some\nimportant subtleties and considerations that make them worth considering\nseparately.\n\n### 2.2.1. Dipole-dipole forces\n\nIt is clear that if opposite charges attract and like charges repel,\nthen neutral (uncharged) species in which charges are separated\n(polarized) must also attract or repel. Whether the species attract or\nrepel depends on their mutual orientation. Consider two water molecules:\nif the hydrogen atoms of one molecule are pointed toward the oxygen atom\nof the other (specifically, the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen\natom), then there will be an attractive interaction; if the two oxygen\natoms are facing each other, there will be a repulsive interaction.\nHowever, unless we are at **absolute zero**[^2.2.2] (we never get even close\nto absolute zero in most engineering applications), the molecules will\nbe tumbling around very quickly, so these attractive and repulsive\ninteractions will occur, and then the molecules will find a different\norientation very quickly (on the order of femtoseconds at room\ntemperature!). Nevertheless, since the attractive interactions are\nenergetically favorable, the molecules will tend to spend more time with\ntheir dipoles aligned (partially positive H atoms pointed toward\npartially negative O atoms). This bias in the orientations of the\nmolecules creates a force between the molecules that is overall\nattractive (i.e., negative sign). As the molecules get closer together,\nthey spend even more time in the favorable orientation. Temperature has\na big effect on the dipole-dipole force; the higher the temperature, the\nmore the molecules are free to rotate. This extra energy allows them to\nspend more time away from the orientations in which the dipoles are\naligned. Thus, the overall strength of the dipole-dipole attractive\nforce decreases with both increasing separation and increasing\ntemperature. That's why both $r$ and $T$ are in the denominator of\nequation (2.3).\n\n(Equation 2.3)\n$$w(r)_{dip-dip}=-\\frac{u_{1}^{2}u_{2}^{2}}{3(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}kTr^{6}}$$\n\n#### Hydrogen bonding\n\nHydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that\noccurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to an electronegative atom\n(usually O, N, F, or Cl). In this bonding arrangement, electron density\nis sucked toward the electronegative atom and the H atom is highly\npositively charged (since it only has one electron to begin with). Thus,\nthe hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom can be thought\nof as almost a naked proton. Much of the positive charge which is\nunshielded by the electron can create a dipole-dipole interaction with\nthe negative part of a nearby dipolar molecule. This interaction is\nespecially strong when the nearby negative charge is a lone pair of\nelectrons on nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, or fluorine. Note that this\ntype of interaction---a hydrogen bond---does not imply a true \"sharing\"\nof the proton between molecules, nor is it nearly as strong as a pure\nCoulombic (charge-charge) interaction between two ions. Nevertheless, it\nis strong enough to dominate the interactions between molecules capable\nof hydrogen bonding (think of the interactions between the As, Cs, Gs,\nand Ts of DNA, whose hydrogen bonds provide the \"rungs\" of the spiral\nstaircase-like double helix). Hydrogen bonds thus dominate the\nproperties of some of the most familiar substances, such as water.\nWithout hydrogen bonding, water---with a molecular weight of 18 g\nmol$^{-1}$---would certainly be a gas, even at very low temperatures,\nand life would be impossible.\n\n### 2.2.2. Dipole-induced dipole forces\n\nAs its name implies, the dipole-dipole interaction requires both\nmolecules of the interacting pair to have a permanent separation of\ncharge, or **permanent dipole**. However, a permanent dipole can also\ninteract with the *electron cloud* of a nearby molecule---whether it has\na permanent dipole or not---to form an **induced dipole**. Atoms and\nmolecules consist of tightly packed, positively charged nuclei\nsurrounded by comparatively diffuse clouds of negatively charged\nelectrons. These electron clouds can be shifted or deflected in an\nelectric field. This shifting is analogous to the orientation of a flag\nwith respect to the flagpole relative to the direction of the wind. In\nthis analogy, the direction of the electric field corresponds to the\ndirection of the wind. The source of the electric field can be from the\ncharged plates of a capacitor, an ion, or the permanent dipole of a\nnearby molecule. In the diagram below (Figure (2.3)), the dipole of\n\"molecule 1\" produces an electric field which causes the electron cloud\nof \"molecule 2\" to deflect.\n\n(Figure 2.3) \n>>>image(debye.png.0)\n\nIf the negatively charged region of the permanent dipole of molecule 1\nis oriented toward the electron cloud of the molecule 2, then the\nelectron cloud is pushed away. The resulting temporary (induced) dipole\nof 2 is oriented parallel to that of 1. This arrangement creates an\nattractive (negative) force. It is important to note that this type of\ninteraction can occur whether the molecule 2 is polar or nonpolar. If\nmolecule 2 is polar, then there are dipole-induced dipole forces on top\nof the dipole-dipole forces which are already present. In either case,\nthe ease with which the electron cloud can be displaced from its\nequilibrium position about the nucleus is given by a parameter called\nthe **polarizability**. The polarizability is proportional to the\nstrength of the dipole induced by an electric field, $E$.\n\n(Equation 2.4) $$u=\\alpha_{0}E$$\n\nwhere $u$ is the dipole moment and $\\alpha_{0}$ is the electronic\npolarizability. The subscript \"0\" is there to remind ourselves that the\nelectron cloud is polarizable in *every* molecule, whether or not it has\na permanent dipole. You may see $\\alpha$ by itself referring to the\ntotal polarizability when one considers the ability to orient a\npermanent dipole with an electric field as a type of polarizability.\nThat is, $\\alpha_{dip}$ is the **dipolar polarizability**\n($\\alpha_{dip}$), sometimes useful in thinking about the ease with which\npermanent dipoles align in an electric field as in the dipole-dipole\nforce. However, to avoid confusion, after displaying equation (2.5),\nbelow, we will not mention $\\alpha_{dip}$ again in this book.\n\n(Equation 2.5) $$\\alpha = \\alpha_{dip} + \\alpha_{0}$$\n\nFactors influencing $\\alpha_{0}$ of an atom or molecule are atomic\nnumber and number of bonds. The rule of thumb is that the farther away\nthe negatively charged electrons are from the positively charged nuclei,\nthe easier the electrons---considered as a diffuse electron cloud---are\nto deflect in the presence of an electric field. Thus, the\ndipole-induced dipole interaction (again, energy), is given by equation\n(2.6), below.\n\n(Equation 2.6)\n$$w(r)_{dip-ind}=-\\frac{2u^{2}\\alpha_{0}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}r^{6}}$$\n\n### 2.2.3. London dispersion forces\n\nThe third, final, and in many ways most important part of the van der\nWaals force exists between all atoms and molecules---whether polar or\nnon-polar, charged or uncharged. It arises because the electrons of all\natoms and molecules are constantly buzzing around their parent\npositively charged nucleii. If you were able to take an instantaneous\nsnapshot of an atom or molecule, you would find that there is, by\nchance, more electron density on one side of the molecule than another.\nThus, all molecules have these short-lived, instantaneous dipoles\narising from the electrons buzzing around the nucleus (for an atom) or\nnuclei (of a molecule). See Figure (2.4)\n\n(Figure 2.4) \n>>>image(london.png.0)\n\nThe instantaneous dipoles in molecule 1 last for around 10$^{-15}$ s (1\nfemtosecond), but they are strong enough to induce a dipole in molecule 2. The strength of the transient dipole in molecule 1 can be comparable\nto that of a permanent dipole. Thus, the strength of the induced dipole\nof molecule 2 is comparable to that produced in either the dipole-dipole\nor the dipole-induced dipole force. Unlike in the dipole-induced dipole\ninteraction, London dispersion interactions can happen between any part\nof the two molecules, and thus they add up quickly for molecules of\nappreciable size. In fact, even for highly polar, hydrogen-bonding\nmolecules like HCl, the contribution of the London dispersion\ninteraction to the total van der Waals energy is greater than that of\nthe energies from the dipole-dipole and dipole-induced interactions put\ntogether. The way in which London dispersion force add up is the reason\nwhy butane (C$_{4}$H$_{10}$) is a gas, decane (C$_{10}$H$_{22}$) is a\nliquid, and octadecane (C$_{18}$H$_{38}$) is a solid, all at room\ntemperature (25 $^{\\circ}$C or 298 K) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm,\n760 mmHg, or 105 Pa). Each additional CH $_{2}$ unit adds around 7.5 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$. As a rule of thumb, it takes a bond strength between\nmolecules of very roughly 75 kJ mol$^{-1}$ for molecules to bind\nstrongly enough with each other to condense into a liquid. Hence, decane\nis a liquid.\n\nThe London equation is as follows\n\n(Equation 2.7)\n$$w(r)_{disp}=-\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{I\\alpha_{0}^{2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}r^{6}}$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the **ionization energy**, which is the energy required to\neject the most loosely held electron from the atom or molecule under\nconsideration.[^2.2.3] London derived this equation using a quantum\nmechanical approach called perturbation theory. However, a close\napproximation can be obtained using the equation for the dipole-induced\ndipole energy, where we use a transient dipole consisting of an electron\nrevolving around its nucleus instead of the permanent dipole.\n\n### 2.2.4. Dielectric constant\n\nEach of the expressions for $w(r)_{dip-dip}, w(r)_{dip-ind},$ and\n$w(r)_{disp}$---equations (2.3), (2.6), and (2.7)---are valid for\ninteractions in a vacuum (or air). However, in most physical systems,\ninteractions are occurring in a solvent medium. In biological systems,\nthe solvent medium is usually water. For $w(r)_{dip-dip}$ and\n$w(r)_{dip-ind}$, the effect of the solvent medium is usually to reduce\nthe potential energy of the interaction through a property called\n**relative permittivity**[^2.2.4] or **dielectric constant**. To calculate\nthis effect, one simply puts the dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ into the\ndenominator of equations (2.3) and (2.6).[^2.2.5] For water, $\\epsilon=78$\nat room temperature, or 298K. This is considered a reasonably high value\nof dielectric constant among solvents.\n\nThe dielectric constant is influenced by at least four factors\n\n1.  electronic polarizability (which is possessed by all atoms and\n    molecules)\n\n2.  dipole moment (which is possessed only by polar molecules)\n\n3.  dipole density (because smaller polar molecules have higher\n    densities in terms of molecules per unit volume)\n\n4.  H-bonding (which locks in the polarization of the medium)\n\nWhen we slap an $\\epsilon$ in the denominator of an equation for\npotential energy, we are treating it as a property of the medium. That\nis, a **continuum theory**. However, it is worth considering the\n**molecular theory** or mechanism behind how the dielectric constant\nreduces electrostatic potential energies of dissolved solutes. A\nhigh-dielectric solvent is composed of individual dipolar molecules.\nThese dipoles can orient around polar or charged solutes. For example,\nwhen a sodium ion, Na$^+$, is placed in a solution of water, the lone\npairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms associate with the positively\ncharged ion. It costs energy to orient dipolar molecules in this way,\nand thus the interaction (ion-dipole, in this case) \"uses up\" some of\nthe electrostatic potential energy of the ion. There is thus less\npotential energy for the solute to interact with another solute. One way\nin which this **stabilization**---i.e., lowering of the electrostatic\npotential energy---of the the sodium ion manifests is in the form of a\nhydration shell of oriented water molecules which develops around an ion\nwhen placed in a solvent. For highly hydrated ions, the charges are\npartially neutralized by the orientation of the dipoles of the solvent.\nThe overall strength of the interaction of this ion with others in\nsolution is reduced. Hence, the dielectric constant appears in the\ndenominator.\n\n[^2.2.1]: Examples of molecules with no electric dipole include methane,\n    CH$_4$, and benzene, C$_6$H$_6$; examples of molecules with a\n    permanent dipole include water and ammonia, NH$_3$.\n\n[^2.2.2]: Absolute zero means 0 $^{\\circ}$ Kelvin, the temperature at which\n    all atoms in the observed system would be perfecctly stationary - it\n    is virtually impossible to attain or measure, because the act of\n    measurement introduces some degree of motion, and thus, temperature,\n    into the system\n\n[^2.2.3]: The ionization energy equals the product of Planck's constant\n    times the frequency of the lowest energy photon that will kick out\n    an electron from the system, $I=h\\nu$, where $\\nu\\approx10^{-15}$Hz.\n    The value of Planck's constant is $6.626\\times10^{-34}$Js.\n\n[^2.2.4]: Relative to air or vacuum, where $\\epsilon=1$.\n\n[^2.2.5]: For the London dispersion interaction, (2.7), the effect of the\n    dielectric constant is not so simple, since the effects of many\n    nearby oscillating electron clouds have a complicated effect on the\n    induced dipole of a reference molecule. For the sake of simplicity,\n    we will only ask you to calculate dispersion energies in air or\n    vacuum. For more complicated systems of nanoparticles and surfaces\n    discussed in the next chapter, empirically determined values will be\n    provided to you. You shouldn't feel cheated, however, since that is\n    how we do things as experimental researchers in the laboratory.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Total van der Waals force\n#### Adding up the forces between atoms and molecules\n\nIn high school, you probably learned that the van der Waals interaction\nwas synonymous with the London dispersion interaction. More properly,\nthe van der Waals interaction includes not only the dispersion\ninteraction, but also the dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole\ninteractions. All three interaction energies depend on the distance\nbetween the particles $r$ as $r^{-6}$. If the $r^{-6}$ is term is\nfactored out, what is left is a series of constants specific to the two\nmolecules, containing the dipole moments, the polarizabilities, factors\nof $k_{B}$ and T, $\\pi$, and the permittivity of free space. Each one of\nthese terms can be \"balled up\" into its own constant, $C$, for\ndipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and dispersion\n($C_{dip-dip}, C_{dip-ind}$, and $C_{disp}$). These three $C$s can be\nadded up to get $C_{VDW}$. So, if you know the van der Waals constant,\n$C_{VDW}$, you can get the interaction energy as a function of\nseparation, $r$.\n\n$$w(r)_{VDW}=w(r)_{dip-dip}+w(r)_{dip-ind}+w(r)_{disp}$$\n$$w(r)_{VDW}=-(\\frac{C_{dip-dip}}{r^{6}}+\\frac{C_{dip-ind}}{r^6}+\\frac{C_{disp}}{r^{6}})$$\n$$w(r)_{VDW}=-\\frac{C_{VDW}}{r^{6}}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$C_{VDW}=\\frac{u_{1}^{2}u_{2}^{2}}{3(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}kT}+\\frac{2u^{2}\\alpha_{0}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}}+\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{I\\alpha_{0}^{2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}}$$\n\nWe know, this equation looks complicated. However, things get simplified\nquickly since pretty much every term is a constant and can be read off a\ntable. Moreover, most of the time, $r$ is usually also a constant in\nmost calculations. That is, in a solid or liquid, where the molecules\nare \"touching,\" $r = \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is two times the van der\nWaals radius of the atom, $\\sigma=2r_{VDW}$. This value, $\\sigma$, can\nbe treated as the diameter of an atom in a **van der Waals solid**, as\ndetermined by X-ray diffraction.[^2.3.1] Another way to think about $\\sigma$\nis the length of a van der Waals bond between atoms. Keep in mind that\nthis bond length is much larger than distance between nuclei for\ncovalent (chemical) bonds. The reason is that in the van der Waals\nframework, the electron clouds barely overlap; in covalent bonds, the\nelectron clouds are shared, and thus the nuclei are very close together.\nThus, for **condensed phases** (solids and liquids), one can simply plug\nin $\\sigma$, the temperature, and the other constants, and out pops the\npair potential! Moreover, for solids, this pair potential can be\nmultiplied by a factor of $6 \\times N_A$ where $N_A$ is Avogadro's\nnumber to get the **molar cohesive energy** of the solid! All from some\nknowledge of dipole moments, polarizabilities, and ionization energies.\n\n[^2.3.1]: A van der Waals solid is a solid held together by van der\n    Waals---as opposed to covalent---bonds.\n",

In fact, in the next chapter,\nwe will learn that the van der Waals adhesive pressure between two\ncompletely flat objects is on the order of 1000 atm! However, we know\nfrom experience that there must be other forces which prevent objects\nfrom smooshing into each other, never to be separated. The fundamental\nforce that prevents objects from passing through each other arises from\nthe **Pauli exclusion principle**, which says that no two\nparticles---electrons in our case---with the same quantum numbers can\noccupy the same physical space. Thus, the electrons in your hand\ninteracting with the electrons in your keyboard, your phone, or this\nbook produce a strong repulsive force at very small separations.\n\nWe have learned that the attractive forces arising from the van der\nWaals potential energies fall off with separation at a rate proportional\nto $\\frac{1}{r^6}$. It turns out that repulsive forces due to Pauli\nexclusion fall off much, much faster, $\\frac{1}{r^{12}}$, but dominate\nat very small distances.

      "content": "#### Section 5: The scale of energies and forces\nThis section has been very theoretical so far. However, the expressions\nfor energies and forces really do have physical manifestations. It is\nthus worth thinking about how these quantities line up with those of\nmore familiar concepts. For example, the strength of a covalent bond in\nchemistry, along with the strong ionic bond between oppositely charged\nions, is on the order of 100 kJ mol$^{-1}$ (a carbon-carbon bond is more\nlike 400 kJ mol$^{-1}$). Double bonds are about 50% higher than that, in\ntotal, because there are two bonds instead of one. However, in chemistry\nwe are used to talking about moles of things---$10^{23}$\nparticles---which is not always useful in nanoengineering.\n\nOne reason that nanoengineers and physicists wouldn't want to use moles\nin calculations is that we are often interested in the interaction of a\nsingle molecule to a surface, or the binding of a single nanoparticle to\na cell (or a small handful of these interactions). So, we use units for\nenergy that are much smaller than what we have been trained to think\nabout in a chemistry class. The strength of a covalent or ionic bond on\na *per bond basis* is on the order of $10^{-19}$ J. These numbers are so\nabsurdly small that we introduce a new unit, **the thermal energy**\n$k_{B}T$, or usually just $kT$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant\n($1.38\\times10^{-23}$ J K$^{-1}$) and $T$ is the temperature, by\nconvention taken as 298K (25 $^{\\circ}$ C, unless noted otherwise). So,\n$kT=4.01\\times10^{-21}$ J.\n\nThus, the energy of a covalent or ionic bond is now on the order of 100\n$kT$ and that of a van der Waals bond is 1 $kT$ (like methane, CH $_{4}$\n, or argon, Ar). For an especially strong noncovalent bond, like a\nhydrogen bond, the energy may go as high as 10 $\\times kT$, which makes\nsense, because water is a liquid at room temperature. A good rule of\nthumb is that if the intermolecular **pair potential**---van der Waals\nenergy at separation $\\sigma$---is $\\geq 10 kT$, then there is a good\nchance that this species is a liquid or a solid (a *condensed phase*) at\nroom temperature.\n\nUsing units of $kT$ gives us nice numbers, like 1, 10, and 100, without\nneeding to consider the huge negative exponents. Conveniently, it also\nhappens that the strength of a bond between molecules in units of $kT$\nis the same order of magnitude as the strength of all the bonds in a\nmole of molecules in units of kJ mol$^{-1}$. So, a covalent bond has an\nenergy of around 100 $kT$ per atom and around 100 kJ mol$^{-1}$ (order\nof magnitude only). In terms of forces, a covalent or ionic bond can be\nseparated by around 1 nN (mnemonic: nanoengineering, nanonewton). The\nforce needed to separate a strong hydrogen bond is around 100 pN, and\nthat needed to separate a normal van der Waals bond in contact is around\n10 pN.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Energy and force\nThere are two types of forces that exist between individual atoms, ions,\nand molecules. The first type is based on the formal sharing of\nelectrons. That is, **covalent bonds**, which you learned all about in\nyour chemistry classes. The second type is based on **electrostatic\ninteractions**. That is, Coulombic interactions between objects with\nformal charges and partial charges in the form of dipoles. A subset of\nCoulombic interactions include the **van der Waals forces** arising from\ndipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and dispersion interactions. The\nimportance of such interactions in predicting the behavior of physical,\nchemical, and biological systems comes from the fact that they exist\nbetween all atoms, ions, and molecules at all times. While not all atoms\nare capable of forming covalent bonds with each other, *every* atom or\nmolecule experiences van der Waals interactions with every other atom or\nmolecule in its vicinity. From these interactions arise most of\nbiological function and much of the behavior of matter. For a video\nprimer to this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/CgazkHdBQmo)\n\nPhenomena that occur on the nanoscale arise from a few guiding\nprinciples. First off, just like the items in your once nicely organized\ndesk or bedroom, stuff likes to spread out. In physics, this tendency is\nsometimes due to entropy. That is, there are more ways of charges,\nparticles, and molecules to be spread out than there are for the same\nitems to be arranged neatly. Thus, the individual components of systems\ntend to adjust themselves such that they are spread out as much as\npossible. In the case of particles with the same charge (e.g., a bunch\nof negatively charged ions) spreading out is due to electrostatic\nrepulsion of like charges. In fact, even a solitary charge will\nexperience \"self repulsion\" and take up as much volume as possible.[^2.1.1]\nWhen particles and charges spread out, the potential energy is lower\nthan when the same species are confined. See Figure (2.1) for examples\nof systems with high and low potential energy.\n\n(Figure 2.1) \n>>>image(highlowpotential.png.0)\n\nDifferences in potential energies of states lead to physical forces\nwhich make change happen. These forces act to decrease the potential\nenergy of the system, from high potential energy to low potential\nenergy. (For example, the high gravitational potential energy of\nstanding at the top of a hill to the low potential energy of standing at\nthe base of the hill.) The potential energies of confined systems tend\nto be larger than those of relaxed systems. The higher energies\nassociated with confined systems lead to bigger driving forces for\nchange to occur. For example, there is comparatively a larger difference\nin the free energies of the products and reactants in a chemical\nreaction when one of the reactants is constrained somehow: picture a\nring-shaped molecule that \"wants\" to open up to form a linear chain (the\nreasons are both entropic and quantum mechanical). Or, consider the fact\nthat a small ion---whose charge is confined and uptight---has more to\ngain by associating with an ion of the opposite charge than does a large\nion---whose charge is spread out and relaxed. Finally, when particles\nsuch as electrons are confined to small spaces (e.g., in a **quantum\ndot**), larger energies (smaller wavelengths) of photons of light are\neither absorbed, emitted, or scattered. If this does not make sense\nnow---energy, entropy, absorption, emission, etc.---don't worry, our\ngoal by the end of this book is to make it make sense.\n\nIt's worth taking a closer look at what we mean by energy and force. In\nhigh school physics and chemistry, much is made of the distinction\nbetween potential energy and kinetic energy. You probably spent several\nweeks talking about kinematics of billiard balls, projectiles, and\nballistic trajectories. Indeed, kinetic energy is useful when discussing\nthe kinetic theory of gasses, along with **dissipative** processes such\nas friction.[^2.1.2] However, in nanoengineering and in the dynamics of\nmolecules and particles in solution, **potential energy** is a more\nuseful concept than kinetic energy. The reason is as we are more\ninterested in how a system came to be and how it might change, rather\nthan how fast its pieces are moving.\n\nThe potential energy of a system is equal to the work needed (positive\nwork) or done (negative work) to bring the system into existence, with\nall the components at defined locations. To deconstruct the system---to\ntake all of the atoms and molecules and separate them into\ninfinity---requires the same amount of energy, but with the opposite\nsign. When a system consisting of objects of any size have a lower\nenergy than all of the components considered separately, the system has\na **favorable** (i.e., negative) potential energy. Potential energy is\ndeeply connected to the concept of force. Force is the rate of change of\nthe potential energy with respect to some change in the system. It turns\nout that these seemingly abstract concepts control a vast range of\nnatural phenomena when applied on the nanoscale. For example, from\nproperties of substances such as the stickiness of glue and the cleaning\npower of soap, to basically all of chemistry and biology.\n\n### 2.1.1. Electrostatic interactions\n\nLet's make these broad statements more concrete: Say you have two\ncharged particles. They could be made of plastic, metal, or rock, or\neven single ions, like Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ separated by distance $r$,\nsee Figure (2.2).\n\n(Figure 2.2) \n>>>image(NaCl.png.0)\n\nAny time two objects---including atoms, ions, molecules, fingers,\nbuildings, or planets---are near each other, there is some kind of\npotential energy between them, or **interaction energy**, **interaction\npotential**, or **potential energy of interaction**. Think of the\ngravitational potential energy between you and the Earth when you are\nsomeplace high up, like on a diving board. On the diving board, your\npotential energy is high. On the ground, it is low. The potential energy\nbetween two particles---atoms, ions, and molecules---can be either high\nor low at a given separation depending on how the objects are charged.\nParticles with like charges (i.e., two negatives) have high potential\nenergy; those with unlike charges have lower potential energy. In either\ncase, the potential energy changes as the particles are brought closer\ntogether or farther apart.\n\nIf we are talking about small numbers of atoms, ions, and molecules, the\ndominant source of the potential energy is electrostatic. That is,\nopposite charges attract and like charges repel. Words like \"attract\"\nand \"repel\" refer to the **force** of the interaction. However, the\naccounting of the interaction on our balance sheet is done using the\n*energy*. The reason is that it is the energy, not the force, that must\nbe conserved in any process.[^2.1.3]\n\nIn this chapter and throughout the book, when we say energy, we are\nalmost always talking about the potential energy. To drive home the\npoint, in nanoscale interactions, we generally don't care that much\nabout kinetic energy. That is, the energy of movement. Exceptions are\nwhen we need to deal with effects that come from the motion of large\nnumbers of particles, like the pressure exerted by gasses and the forces\nof friction. In these cases, kinetic energy takes on an important role.\n\nThe potential energy of a generic interaction is given by\n\n$$w(r)=\\frac{C}{r^n}$$\n\nwhere $w(r)$ is the potential energy of interaction between two objects,\n$C$ is a constant that takes into account the properties of the two\ninteracting objects, $r$ is the separation between the centers of the\ntwo objects, and $n$ is an integer related to the type of interaction.\nFor electrostatic energy, $n=1$ and\n\n(Equation 2.1) $$C_{Coulomb's law}=\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nwhere the $Q$s are the charges ($-1 \\times e$ for Cl$^{-}$ and\n$+1 \\times e$ for Na$^+$), and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free\nspace. The constant $e$ is the **fundamental charge**, or the charge of\nan electron or proton.[^2.1.4] If one charge is negative and the other is\npositive, the overall potential energy is negative. It is useful to\nbreak the $Q$s down into two components, $z$ and $e$, where $z$ is the\n**valency**. For Na$^+$, $z=1$; for Ca$^{2+}$, $z=2$, and so on.[^2.1.5]\n\nWhat does it mean to have a negative potential energy? Before answering\nthe question, it is worth considering what the potential energy actually\nmeans. The potential energy is equivalent to the work done in order to\nbring the objects together. In this thought experiment, the particles\nare initially separated by infinite distance. In the case of two\noppositely charged particles, which in a sense \"want\" to interact, it\ntakes *negative* work. That is, the system kind of does the work for\nyou. To put two particles with the same charge in close proximity, it\nwould have taken some effort. That is, positive work.[^2.1.6]\n\nIt is sometimes thought that a negative potential energy between two\nobjects implies an attractive force. This simple assumption is often\ntrue, but not always. The more important criterion for determining the\ntype of force (attractive or repulsive) than the sign of the energy at a\nfixed separation is what happens to the energy when the particles get\ncloser together or further apart. That is, does the energy increase or\ndecrease? If the potential energy decreases when the objects come closer\ntogether, the force between the objects is attractive; if it increases,\nthe force is repulsive. So, the sign of the potential energy at a fixed\nseparation, $r$ (whether it is negative or positive) means nothing in\nterms of force. *What matters is the rate of change* of $w(r)$ with\nrespect to separation, $r$. This rate of change is equal to the force.\n\n(Equation 2.2) $$F(r) = -\\frac{dw(r)}{dr}$$\n\nWhere the $d$s refer to small incremental differences $(\\Delta$s) in\neither energy (numerator) or separation (denominator). We need to have\nthe negative sign out front to make sure that attractive interactions\nhave negative forces. Convince yourself by putting the sign of the\noverall force in the squares below (Table (2.1)).\n\nTable (2.1)\n\n|      | $w(r)$inc | $w(r)$dec |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| $r$inc |           |           |\n| $r$dec |           |           |\n\n  >Determine the sign of the force in the four blank squares\n\nNote that the convention that *negative force* implies *attractive\ninteraction* is arbitrary---just for convenience and consistency.\nNegative or decreasing quantities imply driving force or stability of a\nsystem relative to a **reference state**. A reference state is almost\nalways considered to be a system of particles that do not interact, as\nin when they are held at infinite distance. We close this section by\nsaying that the above arguments and equations are valid for all charged\nobjects of any size: from ions to charged plastic spheres.\n\n[^2.1.1]: This principle explains why the iodide ion, I$^-$, has a lower\n    potential energy than the much smaller fluoride ion, F$^-$\n\n[^2.1.2]: Dissipative means that an initially directed form of energy like a\n    foot stomp is transformed into a multitude of processes for which\n    it's more difficult to account: sound waves, microscopic damage to\n    your shoe sole and the floor, molecular motion, and heat.\n\n[^2.1.3]: A fundamental concern in all of engineering is to keep track of\n    where all the energy goes: inputs from fossil fuels, the sun, and\n    the wind, and outputs in the form of useful work. Less useful\n    outcomes like friction, heat, and sound waves, are often things to\n    be suppressed. Since these loss mechanisms have their origins in\n    processes that occur on the nanoscale and molecular scale (often at\n    the interfaces between unlike materials), reducing these sources of\n    energy loss are a huge opportunity for nanoengineers!\n\n[^2.1.4]: $e=1.6\\times10^{-19}$C, where the unit C is one Coulomb, or the\n    amount of charge that flows in a current of one Ampere over the\n    course of one second, A $\\times$ s.\n\n[^2.1.5]: The valency is also where the negative sign gets re-introduced.\n    For the ionic interaction between sodium and chloride, NaCl, $z_1=1$\n    and $z_2=-1$.\n\n[^2.1.6]: Potential energies are so important in chemistry and\n    nanoengineering, that when we say \"potential,\" \"potential function,\"\n    or even just \"energy,\" we are always talking about the potential\n    energy.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Van der Waals interactions\nNot all objects are permanently charged like Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$. Even so,\nthere will still be an electrostatic interaction between objects, even\nif they are not charged! In fact, there usually is such an interaction,\neven between completely nonpolar molecules.[^2.2.1] This interaction arises\nbecause of the separation of charges in a neutral molecule or because of\ntransient (short-lived) shifting of the negatively charged electron\nclouds around the positively charged nuclei. The short-lived electrical\ndipoles that form as a result of this movement of the electron clouds is\ncalled **transient polarization**. The type of interaction that arises\nwhen uncharged (but still possibly dipolar) molecules get close to each\nother---the **van der Waals interaction**---has three separate\ncomponents that operate by similar principles. These three components\nare the **dipole-dipole** interaction (Keesom), the **dipole-induced\ndipole** interaction (Debye), and the **dispersion** interaction\n(London). The proper names in parentheses refer to the scientists who\nfirst described these forces. Sometimes these interactions are called\n\"forces,\" but I want to be clear that we are usually talking about\npotential energies, not forces. Saying that a nanoparticle interacts\nwith a cell in terms of kJ mol$^{-1}$ makes a lot more intuitive sense\nthan saying that it interacts by a nN (nano newton) or whatever. All\nthree components of the van der Waals interaction boil down to the\n**Coulomb interaction** between electrical dipoles. That is, the\npositively charged side of the first dipole is attracted to the negative\nside of the second dipole. However, each one of the components has some\nimportant subtleties and considerations that make them worth considering\nseparately.\n\n### 2.2.1. Dipole-dipole forces\n\nIt is clear that if opposite charges attract and like charges repel,\nthen neutral (uncharged) species in which charges are separated\n(polarized) must also attract or repel. Whether the species attract or\nrepel depends on their mutual orientation. Consider two water molecules:\nif the hydrogen atoms of one molecule are pointed toward the oxygen atom\nof the other (specifically, the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen\natom), then there will be an attractive interaction; if the two oxygen\natoms are facing each other, there will be a repulsive interaction.\nHowever, unless we are at **absolute zero**[^2.2.2] (we never get even close\nto absolute zero in most engineering applications), the molecules will\nbe tumbling around very quickly, so these attractive and repulsive\ninteractions will occur, and then the molecules will find a different\norientation very quickly (on the order of femtoseconds at room\ntemperature!). Nevertheless, since the attractive interactions are\nenergetically favorable, the molecules will tend to spend more time with\ntheir dipoles aligned (partially positive H atoms pointed toward\npartially negative O atoms). This bias in the orientations of the\nmolecules creates a force between the molecules that is overall\nattractive (i.e., negative sign). As the molecules get closer together,\nthey spend even more time in the favorable orientation. Temperature has\na big effect on the dipole-dipole force; the higher the temperature, the\nmore the molecules are free to rotate. This extra energy allows them to\nspend more time away from the orientations in which the dipoles are\naligned. Thus, the overall strength of the dipole-dipole attractive\nforce decreases with both increasing separation and increasing\ntemperature. That's why both $r$ and $T$ are in the denominator of\nequation (2.3).\n\n(Equation 2.3)\n$$w(r)_{dip-dip}=-\\frac{u_{1}^{2}u_{2}^{2}}{3(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}kTr^{6}}$$\n\n#### Hydrogen bonding\n\nHydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that\noccurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to an electronegative atom\n(usually O, N, F, or Cl). In this bonding arrangement, electron density\nis sucked toward the electronegative atom and the H atom is highly\npositively charged (since it only has one electron to begin with). Thus,\nthe hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom can be thought\nof as almost a naked proton. Much of the positive charge which is\nunshielded by the electron can create a dipole-dipole interaction with\nthe negative part of a nearby dipolar molecule. This interaction is\nespecially strong when the nearby negative charge is a lone pair of\nelectrons on nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, or fluorine. Note that this\ntype of interaction---a hydrogen bond---does not imply a true \"sharing\"\nof the proton between molecules, nor is it nearly as strong as a pure\nCoulombic (charge-charge) interaction between two ions. Nevertheless, it\nis strong enough to dominate the interactions between molecules capable\nof hydrogen bonding (think of the interactions between the As, Cs, Gs,\nand Ts of DNA, whose hydrogen bonds provide the \"rungs\" of the spiral\nstaircase-like double helix). Hydrogen bonds thus dominate the\nproperties of some of the most familiar substances, such as water.\nWithout hydrogen bonding, water---with a molecular weight of 18 g\nmol$^{-1}$---would certainly be a gas, even at very low temperatures,\nand life would be impossible.\n\n### 2.2.2. Dipole-induced dipole forces\n\nAs its name implies, the dipole-dipole interaction requires both\nmolecules of the interacting pair to have a permanent separation of\ncharge, or **permanent dipole**. However, a permanent dipole can also\ninteract with the *electron cloud* of a nearby molecule---whether it has\na permanent dipole or not---to form an **induced dipole**. Atoms and\nmolecules consist of tightly packed, positively charged nuclei\nsurrounded by comparatively diffuse clouds of negatively charged\nelectrons. These electron clouds can be shifted or deflected in an\nelectric field. This shifting is analogous to the orientation of a flag\nwith respect to the flagpole relative to the direction of the wind. In\nthis analogy, the direction of the electric field corresponds to the\ndirection of the wind. The source of the electric field can be from the\ncharged plates of a capacitor, an ion, or the permanent dipole of a\nnearby molecule. In the diagram below (Figure (2.3)), the dipole of\n\"molecule 1\" produces an electric field which causes the electron cloud\nof \"molecule 2\" to deflect.\n\n(Figure 2.3) \n>>>image(debye.png.0)\n\nIf the negatively charged region of the permanent dipole of molecule 1\nis oriented toward the electron cloud of the molecule 2, then the\nelectron cloud is pushed away. The resulting temporary (induced) dipole\nof 2 is oriented parallel to that of 1. This arrangement creates an\nattractive (negative) force. It is important to note that this type of\ninteraction can occur whether the molecule 2 is polar or nonpolar. If\nmolecule 2 is polar, then there are dipole-induced dipole forces on top\nof the dipole-dipole forces which are already present. In either case,\nthe ease with which the electron cloud can be displaced from its\nequilibrium position about the nucleus is given by a parameter called\nthe **polarizability**. The polarizability is proportional to the\nstrength of the dipole induced by an electric field, $E$.\n\n(Equation 2.4) $$u=\\alpha_{0}E$$\n\nwhere $u$ is the dipole moment and $\\alpha_{0}$ is the electronic\npolarizability. The subscript \"0\" is there to remind ourselves that the\nelectron cloud is polarizable in *every* molecule, whether or not it has\na permanent dipole. You may see $\\alpha$ by itself referring to the\ntotal polarizability when one considers the ability to orient a\npermanent dipole with an electric field as a type of polarizability.\nThat is, $\\alpha_{dip}$ is the **dipolar polarizability**\n($\\alpha_{dip}$), sometimes useful in thinking about the ease with which\npermanent dipoles align in an electric field as in the dipole-dipole\nforce. However, to avoid confusion, after displaying equation (2.5),\nbelow, we will not mention $\\alpha_{dip}$ again in this book.\n\n(Equation 2.5) $$\\alpha = \\alpha_{dip} + \\alpha_{0}$$\n\nFactors influencing $\\alpha_{0}$ of an atom or molecule are atomic\nnumber and number of bonds. The rule of thumb is that the farther away\nthe negatively charged electrons are from the positively charged nuclei,\nthe easier the electrons---considered as a diffuse electron cloud---are\nto deflect in the presence of an electric field. Thus, the\ndipole-induced dipole interaction (again, energy), is given by equation\n(2.6), below.\n\n(Equation 2.6)\n$$w(r)_{dip-ind}=-\\frac{2u^{2}\\alpha_{0}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}r^{6}}$$\n\n### 2.2.3. London dispersion forces\n\nThe third, final, and in many ways most important part of the van der\nWaals force exists between all atoms and molecules---whether polar or\nnon-polar, charged or uncharged. It arises because the electrons of all\natoms and molecules are constantly buzzing around their parent\npositively charged nucleii. If you were able to take an instantaneous\nsnapshot of an atom or molecule, you would find that there is, by\nchance, more electron density on one side of the molecule than another.\nThus, all molecules have these short-lived, instantaneous dipoles\narising from the electrons buzzing around the nucleus (for an atom) or\nnuclei (of a molecule). See Figure (2.4)\n\n(Figure 2.4) \n>>>image(london.png.0)\n\nThe instantaneous dipoles in molecule 1 last for around 10$^{-15}$ s (1\nfemtosecond), but they are strong enough to induce a dipole in molecule 2. The strength of the transient dipole in molecule 1 can be comparable\nto that of a permanent dipole. Thus, the strength of the induced dipole\nof molecule 2 is comparable to that produced in either the dipole-dipole\nor the dipole-induced dipole force. Unlike in the dipole-induced dipole\ninteraction, London dispersion interactions can happen between any part\nof the two molecules, and thus they add up quickly for molecules of\nappreciable size. In fact, even for highly polar, hydrogen-bonding\nmolecules like HCl, the contribution of the London dispersion\ninteraction to the total van der Waals energy is greater than that of\nthe energies from the dipole-dipole and dipole-induced interactions put\ntogether. The way in which London dispersion force add up is the reason\nwhy butane (C$_{4}$H$_{10}$) is a gas, decane (C$_{10}$H$_{22}$) is a\nliquid, and octadecane (C$_{18}$H$_{38}$) is a solid, all at room\ntemperature (25 $^{\\circ}$C or 298 K) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm,\n760 mmHg, or 105 Pa). Each additional CH $_{2}$ unit adds around 7.5 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$. As a rule of thumb, it takes a bond strength between\nmolecules of very roughly 75 kJ mol$^{-1}$ for molecules to bind\nstrongly enough with each other to condense into a liquid. Hence, decane\nis a liquid.\n\nThe London equation is as follows\n\n(Equation 2.7)\n$$w(r)_{disp}=-\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{I\\alpha_{0}^{2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}r^{6}}$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the **ionization energy**, which is the energy required to\neject the most loosely held electron from the atom or molecule under\nconsideration.[^2.2.3] London derived this equation using a quantum\nmechanical approach called perturbation theory. However, a close\napproximation can be obtained using the equation for the dipole-induced\ndipole energy, where we use a transient dipole consisting of an electron\nrevolving around its nucleus instead of the permanent dipole.\n\n### 2.2.4. Dielectric constant\n\nEach of the expressions for $w(r)_{dip-dip}, w(r)_{dip-ind},$ and\n$w(r)_{disp}$---equations (2.3), (2.6), and (2.7)---are valid for\ninteractions in a vacuum (or air). However, in most physical systems,\ninteractions are occurring in a solvent medium. In biological systems,\nthe solvent medium is usually water. For $w(r)_{dip-dip}$ and\n$w(r)_{dip-ind}$, the effect of the solvent medium is usually to reduce\nthe potential energy of the interaction through a property called\n**relative permittivity**[^2.2.4] or **dielectric constant**. To calculate\nthis effect, one simply puts the dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ into the\ndenominator of equations (2.3) and (2.6).[^2.2.5] For water, $\\epsilon=78$\nat room temperature, or 298K. This is considered a reasonably high value\nof dielectric constant among solvents.\n\nThe dielectric constant is influenced by at least four factors\n\n1.  electronic polarizability (which is possessed by all atoms and\n    molecules)\n\n2.  dipole moment (which is possessed only by polar molecules)\n\n3.  dipole density (because smaller polar molecules have higher\n    densities in terms of molecules per unit volume)\n\n4.  H-bonding (which locks in the polarization of the medium)\n\nWhen we slap an $\\epsilon$ in the denominator of an equation for\npotential energy, we are treating it as a property of the medium. That\nis, a **continuum theory**. However, it is worth considering the\n**molecular theory** or mechanism behind how the dielectric constant\nreduces electrostatic potential energies of dissolved solutes. A\nhigh-dielectric solvent is composed of individual dipolar molecules.\nThese dipoles can orient around polar or charged solutes. For example,\nwhen a sodium ion, Na$^+$, is placed in a solution of water, the lone\npairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms associate with the positively\ncharged ion. It costs energy to orient dipolar molecules in this way,\nand thus the interaction (ion-dipole, in this case) \"uses up\" some of\nthe electrostatic potential energy of the ion. There is thus less\npotential energy for the solute to interact with another solute. One way\nin which this **stabilization**---i.e., lowering of the electrostatic\npotential energy---of the the sodium ion manifests is in the form of a\nhydration shell of oriented water molecules which develops around an ion\nwhen placed in a solvent. For highly hydrated ions, the charges are\npartially neutralized by the orientation of the dipoles of the solvent.\nThe overall strength of the interaction of this ion with others in\nsolution is reduced. Hence, the dielectric constant appears in the\ndenominator.\n\n[^2.2.1]: Examples of molecules with no electric dipole include methane,\n    CH$_4$, and benzene, C$_6$H$_6$; examples of molecules with a\n    permanent dipole include water and ammonia, NH$_3$.\n\n[^2.2.2]: Absolute zero means 0 $^{\\circ}$ Kelvin, the temperature at which\n    all atoms in the observed system would be perfecctly stationary - it\n    is virtually impossible to attain or measure, because the act of\n    measurement introduces some degree of motion, and thus, temperature,\n    into the system\n\n[^2.2.3]: The ionization energy equals the product of Planck's constant\n    times the frequency of the lowest energy photon that will kick out\n    an electron from the system, $I=h\\nu$, where $\\nu\\approx10^{-15}$Hz.\n    The value of Planck's constant is $6.626\\times10^{-34}$Js.\n\n[^2.2.4]: Relative to air or vacuum, where $\\epsilon=1$.\n\n[^2.2.5]: For the London dispersion interaction, (2.7), the effect of the\n    dielectric constant is not so simple, since the effects of many\n    nearby oscillating electron clouds have a complicated effect on the\n    induced dipole of a reference molecule. For the sake of simplicity,\n    we will only ask you to calculate dispersion energies in air or\n    vacuum. For more complicated systems of nanoparticles and surfaces\n    discussed in the next chapter, empirically determined values will be\n    provided to you. You shouldn't feel cheated, however, since that is\n    how we do things as experimental researchers in the laboratory.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Energy and force\nThere are two types of forces that exist between individual atoms, ions,\nand molecules. The first type is based on the formal sharing of\nelectrons. That is, **covalent bonds**, which you learned all about in\nyour chemistry classes. The second type is based on **electrostatic\ninteractions**. That is, Coulombic interactions between objects with\nformal charges and partial charges in the form of dipoles. A subset of\nCoulombic interactions include the **van der Waals forces** arising from\ndipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and dispersion interactions. The\nimportance of such interactions in predicting the behavior of physical,\nchemical, and biological systems comes from the fact that they exist\nbetween all atoms, ions, and molecules at all times. While not all atoms\nare capable of forming covalent bonds with each other, *every* atom or\nmolecule experiences van der Waals interactions with every other atom or\nmolecule in its vicinity. From these interactions arise most of\nbiological function and much of the behavior of matter. For a video\nprimer to this chapter, visit \n>>>video(https://youtu.be/CgazkHdBQmo)\n\nPhenomena that occur on the nanoscale arise from a few guiding\nprinciples. First off, just like the items in your once nicely organized\ndesk or bedroom, stuff likes to spread out. In physics, this tendency is\nsometimes due to entropy. That is, there are more ways of charges,\nparticles, and molecules to be spread out than there are for the same\nitems to be arranged neatly. Thus, the individual components of systems\ntend to adjust themselves such that they are spread out as much as\npossible. In the case of particles with the same charge (e.g., a bunch\nof negatively charged ions) spreading out is due to electrostatic\nrepulsion of like charges. In fact, even a solitary charge will\nexperience \"self repulsion\" and take up as much volume as possible.[^2.1.1]\nWhen particles and charges spread out, the potential energy is lower\nthan when the same species are confined. See Figure (2.1) for examples\nof systems with high and low potential energy.\n\n(Figure 2.1) \n>>>image(highlowpotential.png.0)\n\nDifferences in potential energies of states lead to physical forces\nwhich make change happen. These forces act to decrease the potential\nenergy of the system, from high potential energy to low potential\nenergy. (For example, the high gravitational potential energy of\nstanding at the top of a hill to the low potential energy of standing at\nthe base of the hill.) The potential energies of confined systems tend\nto be larger than those of relaxed systems. The higher energies\nassociated with confined systems lead to bigger driving forces for\nchange to occur. For example, there is comparatively a larger difference\nin the free energies of the products and reactants in a chemical\nreaction when one of the reactants is constrained somehow: picture a\nring-shaped molecule that \"wants\" to open up to form a linear chain (the\nreasons are both entropic and quantum mechanical). Or, consider the fact\nthat a small ion---whose charge is confined and uptight---has more to\ngain by associating with an ion of the opposite charge than does a large\nion---whose charge is spread out and relaxed. Finally, when particles\nsuch as electrons are confined to small spaces (e.g., in a **quantum\ndot**), larger energies (smaller wavelengths) of photons of light are\neither absorbed, emitted, or scattered. If this does not make sense\nnow---energy, entropy, absorption, emission, etc.---don't worry, our\ngoal by the end of this book is to make it make sense.\n\nIt's worth taking a closer look at what we mean by energy and force. In\nhigh school physics and chemistry, much is made of the distinction\nbetween potential energy and kinetic energy. You probably spent several\nweeks talking about kinematics of billiard balls, projectiles, and\nballistic trajectories. Indeed, kinetic energy is useful when discussing\nthe kinetic theory of gasses, along with **dissipative** processes such\nas friction.[^2.1.2] However, in nanoengineering and in the dynamics of\nmolecules and particles in solution, **potential energy** is a more\nuseful concept than kinetic energy. The reason is as we are more\ninterested in how a system came to be and how it might change, rather\nthan how fast its pieces are moving.\n\nThe potential energy of a system is equal to the work needed (positive\nwork) or done (negative work) to bring the system into existence, with\nall the components at defined locations. To deconstruct the system---to\ntake all of the atoms and molecules and separate them into\ninfinity---requires the same amount of energy, but with the opposite\nsign. When a system consisting of objects of any size have a lower\nenergy than all of the components considered separately, the system has\na **favorable** (i.e., negative) potential energy. Potential energy is\ndeeply connected to the concept of force. Force is the rate of change of\nthe potential energy with respect to some change in the system. It turns\nout that these seemingly abstract concepts control a vast range of\nnatural phenomena when applied on the nanoscale. For example, from\nproperties of substances such as the stickiness of glue and the cleaning\npower of soap, to basically all of chemistry and biology.\n\n### 2.1.1. Electrostatic interactions\n\nLet's make these broad statements more concrete: Say you have two\ncharged particles. They could be made of plastic, metal, or rock, or\neven single ions, like Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ separated by distance $r$,\nsee Figure (2.2).\n\n(Figure 2.2) \n>>>image(NaCl.png.0)\n\nAny time two objects---including atoms, ions, molecules, fingers,\nbuildings, or planets---are near each other, there is some kind of\npotential energy between them, or **interaction energy**, **interaction\npotential**, or **potential energy of interaction**. Think of the\ngravitational potential energy between you and the Earth when you are\nsomeplace high up, like on a diving board. On the diving board, your\npotential energy is high. On the ground, it is low. The potential energy\nbetween two particles---atoms, ions, and molecules---can be either high\nor low at a given separation depending on how the objects are charged.\nParticles with like charges (i.e., two negatives) have high potential\nenergy; those with unlike charges have lower potential energy. In either\ncase, the potential energy changes as the particles are brought closer\ntogether or farther apart.\n\nIf we are talking about small numbers of atoms, ions, and molecules, the\ndominant source of the potential energy is electrostatic. That is,\nopposite charges attract and like charges repel. Words like \"attract\"\nand \"repel\" refer to the **force** of the interaction. However, the\naccounting of the interaction on our balance sheet is done using the\n*energy*. The reason is that it is the energy, not the force, that must\nbe conserved in any process.[^2.1.3]\n\nIn this chapter and throughout the book, when we say energy, we are\nalmost always talking about the potential energy. To drive home the\npoint, in nanoscale interactions, we generally don't care that much\nabout kinetic energy. That is, the energy of movement. Exceptions are\nwhen we need to deal with effects that come from the motion of large\nnumbers of particles, like the pressure exerted by gasses and the forces\nof friction. In these cases, kinetic energy takes on an important role.\n\nThe potential energy of a generic interaction is given by\n\n$$w(r)=\\frac{C}{r^n}$$\n\nwhere $w(r)$ is the potential energy of interaction between two objects,\n$C$ is a constant that takes into account the properties of the two\ninteracting objects, $r$ is the separation between the centers of the\ntwo objects, and $n$ is an integer related to the type of interaction.\nFor electrostatic energy, $n=1$ and\n\n(Equation 2.1) $$C_{Coulomb's law}=\\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}$$\n\nwhere the $Q$s are the charges ($-1 \\times e$ for Cl$^{-}$ and\n$+1 \\times e$ for Na$^+$), and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free\nspace. The constant $e$ is the **fundamental charge**, or the charge of\nan electron or proton.[^2.1.4] If one charge is negative and the other is\npositive, the overall potential energy is negative. It is useful to\nbreak the $Q$s down into two components, $z$ and $e$, where $z$ is the\n**valency**. For Na$^+$, $z=1$; for Ca$^{2+}$, $z=2$, and so on.[^2.1.5]\n\nWhat does it mean to have a negative potential energy? Before answering\nthe question, it is worth considering what the potential energy actually\nmeans. The potential energy is equivalent to the work done in order to\nbring the objects together. In this thought experiment, the particles\nare initially separated by infinite distance. In the case of two\noppositely charged particles, which in a sense \"want\" to interact, it\ntakes *negative* work. That is, the system kind of does the work for\nyou. To put two particles with the same charge in close proximity, it\nwould have taken some effort. That is, positive work.[^2.1.6]\n\nIt is sometimes thought that a negative potential energy between two\nobjects implies an attractive force. This simple assumption is often\ntrue, but not always. The more important criterion for determining the\ntype of force (attractive or repulsive) than the sign of the energy at a\nfixed separation is what happens to the energy when the particles get\ncloser together or further apart. That is, does the energy increase or\ndecrease? If the potential energy decreases when the objects come closer\ntogether, the force between the objects is attractive; if it increases,\nthe force is repulsive. So, the sign of the potential energy at a fixed\nseparation, $r$ (whether it is negative or positive) means nothing in\nterms of force. *What matters is the rate of change* of $w(r)$ with\nrespect to separation, $r$. This rate of change is equal to the force.\n\n(Equation 2.2) $$F(r) = -\\frac{dw(r)}{dr}$$\n\nWhere the $d$s refer to small incremental differences $(\\Delta$s) in\neither energy (numerator) or separation (denominator). We need to have\nthe negative sign out front to make sure that attractive interactions\nhave negative forces. Convince yourself by putting the sign of the\noverall force in the squares below (Table (2.1)).\n\nTable (2.1)\n\n|      | $w(r)$inc | $w(r)$dec |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| $r$inc |           |           |\n| $r$dec |           |           |\n\n  >Determine the sign of the force in the four blank squares\n\nNote that the convention that *negative force* implies *attractive\ninteraction* is arbitrary---just for convenience and consistency.\nNegative or decreasing quantities imply driving force or stability of a\nsystem relative to a **reference state**. A reference state is almost\nalways considered to be a system of particles that do not interact, as\nin when they are held at infinite distance. We close this section by\nsaying that the above arguments and equations are valid for all charged\nobjects of any size: from ions to charged plastic spheres.\n\n[^2.1.1]: This principle explains why the iodide ion, I$^-$, has a lower\n    potential energy than the much smaller fluoride ion, F$^-$\n\n[^2.1.2]: Dissipative means that an initially directed form of energy like a\n    foot stomp is transformed into a multitude of processes for which\n    it's more difficult to account: sound waves, microscopic damage to\n    your shoe sole and the floor, molecular motion, and heat.\n\n[^2.1.3]: A fundamental concern in all of engineering is to keep track of\n    where all the energy goes: inputs from fossil fuels, the sun, and\n    the wind, and outputs in the form of useful work. Less useful\n    outcomes like friction, heat, and sound waves, are often things to\n    be suppressed. Since these loss mechanisms have their origins in\n    processes that occur on the nanoscale and molecular scale (often at\n    the interfaces between unlike materials), reducing these sources of\n    energy loss are a huge opportunity for nanoengineers!\n\n[^2.1.4]: $e=1.6\\times10^{-19}$C, where the unit C is one Coulomb, or the\n    amount of charge that flows in a current of one Ampere over the\n    course of one second, A $\\times$ s.\n\n[^2.1.5]: The valency is also where the negative sign gets re-introduced.\n    For the ionic interaction between sodium and chloride, NaCl, $z_1=1$\n    and $z_2=-1$.\n\n[^2.1.6]: Potential energies are so important in chemistry and\n    nanoengineering, that when we say \"potential,\" \"potential function,\"\n    or even just \"energy,\" we are always talking about the potential\n    energy.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Van der Waals interactions\nNot all objects are permanently charged like Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$. Even so,\nthere will still be an electrostatic interaction between objects, even\nif they are not charged! In fact, there usually is such an interaction,\neven between completely nonpolar molecules.[^2.2.1] This interaction arises\nbecause of the separation of charges in a neutral molecule or because of\ntransient (short-lived) shifting of the negatively charged electron\nclouds around the positively charged nuclei. The short-lived electrical\ndipoles that form as a result of this movement of the electron clouds is\ncalled **transient polarization**. The type of interaction that arises\nwhen uncharged (but still possibly dipolar) molecules get close to each\nother---the **van der Waals interaction**---has three separate\ncomponents that operate by similar principles. These three components\nare the **dipole-dipole** interaction (Keesom), the **dipole-induced\ndipole** interaction (Debye), and the **dispersion** interaction\n(London). The proper names in parentheses refer to the scientists who\nfirst described these forces. Sometimes these interactions are called\n\"forces,\" but I want to be clear that we are usually talking about\npotential energies, not forces. Saying that a nanoparticle interacts\nwith a cell in terms of kJ mol$^{-1}$ makes a lot more intuitive sense\nthan saying that it interacts by a nN (nano newton) or whatever. All\nthree components of the van der Waals interaction boil down to the\n**Coulomb interaction** between electrical dipoles. That is, the\npositively charged side of the first dipole is attracted to the negative\nside of the second dipole. However, each one of the components has some\nimportant subtleties and considerations that make them worth considering\nseparately.\n\n### 2.2.1. Dipole-dipole forces\n\nIt is clear that if opposite charges attract and like charges repel,\nthen neutral (uncharged) species in which charges are separated\n(polarized) must also attract or repel. Whether the species attract or\nrepel depends on their mutual orientation. Consider two water molecules:\nif the hydrogen atoms of one molecule are pointed toward the oxygen atom\nof the other (specifically, the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen\natom), then there will be an attractive interaction; if the two oxygen\natoms are facing each other, there will be a repulsive interaction.\nHowever, unless we are at **absolute zero**[^2.2.2] (we never get even close\nto absolute zero in most engineering applications), the molecules will\nbe tumbling around very quickly, so these attractive and repulsive\ninteractions will occur, and then the molecules will find a different\norientation very quickly (on the order of femtoseconds at room\ntemperature!). Nevertheless, since the attractive interactions are\nenergetically favorable, the molecules will tend to spend more time with\ntheir dipoles aligned (partially positive H atoms pointed toward\npartially negative O atoms). This bias in the orientations of the\nmolecules creates a force between the molecules that is overall\nattractive (i.e., negative sign). As the molecules get closer together,\nthey spend even more time in the favorable orientation. Temperature has\na big effect on the dipole-dipole force; the higher the temperature, the\nmore the molecules are free to rotate. This extra energy allows them to\nspend more time away from the orientations in which the dipoles are\naligned. Thus, the overall strength of the dipole-dipole attractive\nforce decreases with both increasing separation and increasing\ntemperature. That's why both $r$ and $T$ are in the denominator of\nequation (2.3).\n\n(Equation 2.3)\n$$w(r)_{dip-dip}=-\\frac{u_{1}^{2}u_{2}^{2}}{3(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}kTr^{6}}$$\n\n#### Hydrogen bonding\n\nHydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that\noccurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to an electronegative atom\n(usually O, N, F, or Cl). In this bonding arrangement, electron density\nis sucked toward the electronegative atom and the H atom is highly\npositively charged (since it only has one electron to begin with). Thus,\nthe hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom can be thought\nof as almost a naked proton. Much of the positive charge which is\nunshielded by the electron can create a dipole-dipole interaction with\nthe negative part of a nearby dipolar molecule. This interaction is\nespecially strong when the nearby negative charge is a lone pair of\nelectrons on nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, or fluorine. Note that this\ntype of interaction---a hydrogen bond---does not imply a true \"sharing\"\nof the proton between molecules, nor is it nearly as strong as a pure\nCoulombic (charge-charge) interaction between two ions. Nevertheless, it\nis strong enough to dominate the interactions between molecules capable\nof hydrogen bonding (think of the interactions between the As, Cs, Gs,\nand Ts of DNA, whose hydrogen bonds provide the \"rungs\" of the spiral\nstaircase-like double helix). Hydrogen bonds thus dominate the\nproperties of some of the most familiar substances, such as water.\nWithout hydrogen bonding, water---with a molecular weight of 18 g\nmol$^{-1}$---would certainly be a gas, even at very low temperatures,\nand life would be impossible.\n\n### 2.2.2. Dipole-induced dipole forces\n\nAs its name implies, the dipole-dipole interaction requires both\nmolecules of the interacting pair to have a permanent separation of\ncharge, or **permanent dipole**. However, a permanent dipole can also\ninteract with the *electron cloud* of a nearby molecule---whether it has\na permanent dipole or not---to form an **induced dipole**. Atoms and\nmolecules consist of tightly packed, positively charged nuclei\nsurrounded by comparatively diffuse clouds of negatively charged\nelectrons. These electron clouds can be shifted or deflected in an\nelectric field. This shifting is analogous to the orientation of a flag\nwith respect to the flagpole relative to the direction of the wind. In\nthis analogy, the direction of the electric field corresponds to the\ndirection of the wind. The source of the electric field can be from the\ncharged plates of a capacitor, an ion, or the permanent dipole of a\nnearby molecule. In the diagram below (Figure (2.3)), the dipole of\n\"molecule 1\" produces an electric field which causes the electron cloud\nof \"molecule 2\" to deflect.\n\n(Figure 2.3) \n>>>image(debye.png.0)\n\nIf the negatively charged region of the permanent dipole of molecule 1\nis oriented toward the electron cloud of the molecule 2, then the\nelectron cloud is pushed away. The resulting temporary (induced) dipole\nof 2 is oriented parallel to that of 1. This arrangement creates an\nattractive (negative) force. It is important to note that this type of\ninteraction can occur whether the molecule 2 is polar or nonpolar. If\nmolecule 2 is polar, then there are dipole-induced dipole forces on top\nof the dipole-dipole forces which are already present. In either case,\nthe ease with which the electron cloud can be displaced from its\nequilibrium position about the nucleus is given by a parameter called\nthe **polarizability**. The polarizability is proportional to the\nstrength of the dipole induced by an electric field, $E$.\n\n(Equation 2.4) $$u=\\alpha_{0}E$$\n\nwhere $u$ is the dipole moment and $\\alpha_{0}$ is the electronic\npolarizability. The subscript \"0\" is there to remind ourselves that the\nelectron cloud is polarizable in *every* molecule, whether or not it has\na permanent dipole. You may see $\\alpha$ by itself referring to the\ntotal polarizability when one considers the ability to orient a\npermanent dipole with an electric field as a type of polarizability.\nThat is, $\\alpha_{dip}$ is the **dipolar polarizability**\n($\\alpha_{dip}$), sometimes useful in thinking about the ease with which\npermanent dipoles align in an electric field as in the dipole-dipole\nforce. However, to avoid confusion, after displaying equation (2.5),\nbelow, we will not mention $\\alpha_{dip}$ again in this book.\n\n(Equation 2.5) $$\\alpha = \\alpha_{dip} + \\alpha_{0}$$\n\nFactors influencing $\\alpha_{0}$ of an atom or molecule are atomic\nnumber and number of bonds. The rule of thumb is that the farther away\nthe negatively charged electrons are from the positively charged nuclei,\nthe easier the electrons---considered as a diffuse electron cloud---are\nto deflect in the presence of an electric field. Thus, the\ndipole-induced dipole interaction (again, energy), is given by equation\n(2.6), below.\n\n(Equation 2.6)\n$$w(r)_{dip-ind}=-\\frac{2u^{2}\\alpha_{0}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}r^{6}}$$\n\n### 2.2.3. London dispersion forces\n\nThe third, final, and in many ways most important part of the van der\nWaals force exists between all atoms and molecules---whether polar or\nnon-polar, charged or uncharged. It arises because the electrons of all\natoms and molecules are constantly buzzing around their parent\npositively charged nucleii. If you were able to take an instantaneous\nsnapshot of an atom or molecule, you would find that there is, by\nchance, more electron density on one side of the molecule than another.\nThus, all molecules have these short-lived, instantaneous dipoles\narising from the electrons buzzing around the nucleus (for an atom) or\nnuclei (of a molecule). See Figure (2.4)\n\n(Figure 2.4) \n>>>image(london.png.0)\n\nThe instantaneous dipoles in molecule 1 last for around 10$^{-15}$ s (1\nfemtosecond), but they are strong enough to induce a dipole in molecule 2. The strength of the transient dipole in molecule 1 can be comparable\nto that of a permanent dipole. Thus, the strength of the induced dipole\nof molecule 2 is comparable to that produced in either the dipole-dipole\nor the dipole-induced dipole force. Unlike in the dipole-induced dipole\ninteraction, London dispersion interactions can happen between any part\nof the two molecules, and thus they add up quickly for molecules of\nappreciable size. In fact, even for highly polar, hydrogen-bonding\nmolecules like HCl, the contribution of the London dispersion\ninteraction to the total van der Waals energy is greater than that of\nthe energies from the dipole-dipole and dipole-induced interactions put\ntogether. The way in which London dispersion force add up is the reason\nwhy butane (C$_{4}$H$_{10}$) is a gas, decane (C$_{10}$H$_{22}$) is a\nliquid, and octadecane (C$_{18}$H$_{38}$) is a solid, all at room\ntemperature (25 $^{\\circ}$C or 298 K) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm,\n760 mmHg, or 105 Pa). Each additional CH $_{2}$ unit adds around 7.5 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$. As a rule of thumb, it takes a bond strength between\nmolecules of very roughly 75 kJ mol$^{-1}$ for molecules to bind\nstrongly enough with each other to condense into a liquid. Hence, decane\nis a liquid.\n\nThe London equation is as follows\n\n(Equation 2.7)\n$$w(r)_{disp}=-\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{I\\alpha_{0}^{2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}r^{6}}$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the **ionization energy**, which is the energy required to\neject the most loosely held electron from the atom or molecule under\nconsideration.[^2.2.3] London derived this equation using a quantum\nmechanical approach called perturbation theory. However, a close\napproximation can be obtained using the equation for the dipole-induced\ndipole energy, where we use a transient dipole consisting of an electron\nrevolving around its nucleus instead of the permanent dipole.\n\n### 2.2.4. Dielectric constant\n\nEach of the expressions for $w(r)_{dip-dip}, w(r)_{dip-ind},$ and\n$w(r)_{disp}$---equations (2.3), (2.6), and (2.7)---are valid for\ninteractions in a vacuum (or air). However, in most physical systems,\ninteractions are occurring in a solvent medium. In biological systems,\nthe solvent medium is usually water. For $w(r)_{dip-dip}$ and\n$w(r)_{dip-ind}$, the effect of the solvent medium is usually to reduce\nthe potential energy of the interaction through a property called\n**relative permittivity**[^2.2.4] or **dielectric constant**. To calculate\nthis effect, one simply puts the dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ into the\ndenominator of equations (2.3) and (2.6).[^2.2.5] For water, $\\epsilon=78$\nat room temperature, or 298K. This is considered a reasonably high value\nof dielectric constant among solvents.\n\nThe dielectric constant is influenced by at least four factors\n\n1.  electronic polarizability (which is possessed by all atoms and\n    molecules)\n\n2.  dipole moment (which is possessed only by polar molecules)\n\n3.  dipole density (because smaller polar molecules have higher\n    densities in terms of molecules per unit volume)\n\n4.  H-bonding (which locks in the polarization of the medium)\n\nWhen we slap an $\\epsilon$ in the denominator of an equation for\npotential energy, we are treating it as a property of the medium. That\nis, a **continuum theory**. However, it is worth considering the\n**molecular theory** or mechanism behind how the dielectric constant\nreduces electrostatic potential energies of dissolved solutes. A\nhigh-dielectric solvent is composed of individual dipolar molecules.\nThese dipoles can orient around polar or charged solutes. For example,\nwhen a sodium ion, Na$^+$, is placed in a solution of water, the lone\npairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms associate with the positively\ncharged ion. It costs energy to orient dipolar molecules in this way,\nand thus the interaction (ion-dipole, in this case) \"uses up\" some of\nthe electrostatic potential energy of the ion. There is thus less\npotential energy for the solute to interact with another solute. One way\nin which this **stabilization**---i.e., lowering of the electrostatic\npotential energy---of the the sodium ion manifests is in the form of a\nhydration shell of oriented water molecules which develops around an ion\nwhen placed in a solvent. For highly hydrated ions, the charges are\npartially neutralized by the orientation of the dipoles of the solvent.\nThe overall strength of the interaction of this ion with others in\nsolution is reduced. Hence, the dielectric constant appears in the\ndenominator.\n\n[^2.2.1]: Examples of molecules with no electric dipole include methane,\n    CH$_4$, and benzene, C$_6$H$_6$; examples of molecules with a\n    permanent dipole include water and ammonia, NH$_3$.\n\n[^2.2.2]: Absolute zero means 0 $^{\\circ}$ Kelvin, the temperature at which\n    all atoms in the observed system would be perfecctly stationary - it\n    is virtually impossible to attain or measure, because the act of\n    measurement introduces some degree of motion, and thus, temperature,\n    into the system\n\n[^2.2.3]: The ionization energy equals the product of Planck's constant\n    times the frequency of the lowest energy photon that will kick out\n    an electron from the system, $I=h\\nu$, where $\\nu\\approx10^{-15}$Hz.\n    The value of Planck's constant is $6.626\\times10^{-34}$Js.\n\n[^2.2.4]: Relative to air or vacuum, where $\\epsilon=1$.\n\n[^2.2.5]: For the London dispersion interaction, (2.7), the effect of the\n    dielectric constant is not so simple, since the effects of many\n    nearby oscillating electron clouds have a complicated effect on the\n    induced dipole of a reference molecule. For the sake of simplicity,\n    we will only ask you to calculate dispersion energies in air or\n    vacuum. For more complicated systems of nanoparticles and surfaces\n    discussed in the next chapter, empirically determined values will be\n    provided to you. You shouldn't feel cheated, however, since that is\n    how we do things as experimental researchers in the laboratory.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Total van der Waals force\n#### Adding up the forces between atoms and molecules\n\nIn high school, you probably learned that the van der Waals interaction\nwas synonymous with the London dispersion interaction. More properly,\nthe van der Waals interaction includes not only the dispersion\ninteraction, but also the dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole\ninteractions. All three interaction energies depend on the distance\nbetween the particles $r$ as $r^{-6}$. If the $r^{-6}$ is term is\nfactored out, what is left is a series of constants specific to the two\nmolecules, containing the dipole moments, the polarizabilities, factors\nof $k_{B}$ and T, $\\pi$, and the permittivity of free space. Each one of\nthese terms can be \"balled up\" into its own constant, $C$, for\ndipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, and dispersion\n($C_{dip-dip}, C_{dip-ind}$, and $C_{disp}$). These three $C$s can be\nadded up to get $C_{VDW}$. So, if you know the van der Waals constant,\n$C_{VDW}$, you can get the interaction energy as a function of\nseparation, $r$.\n\n$$w(r)_{VDW}=w(r)_{dip-dip}+w(r)_{dip-ind}+w(r)_{disp}$$\n$$w(r)_{VDW}=-(\\frac{C_{dip-dip}}{r^{6}}+\\frac{C_{dip-ind}}{r^6}+\\frac{C_{disp}}{r^{6}})$$\n$$w(r)_{VDW}=-\\frac{C_{VDW}}{r^{6}}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$C_{VDW}=\\frac{u_{1}^{2}u_{2}^{2}}{3(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}kT}+\\frac{2u^{2}\\alpha_{0}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}}+\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{I\\alpha_{0}^{2}}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_{0})^{2}}$$\n\nWe know, this equation looks complicated. However, things get simplified\nquickly since pretty much every term is a constant and can be read off a\ntable. Moreover, most of the time, $r$ is usually also a constant in\nmost calculations. That is, in a solid or liquid, where the molecules\nare \"touching,\" $r = \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is two times the van der\nWaals radius of the atom, $\\sigma=2r_{VDW}$. This value, $\\sigma$, can\nbe treated as the diameter of an atom in a **van der Waals solid**, as\ndetermined by X-ray diffraction.[^2.3.1] Another way to think about $\\sigma$\nis the length of a van der Waals bond between atoms. Keep in mind that\nthis bond length is much larger than distance between nuclei for\ncovalent (chemical) bonds. The reason is that in the van der Waals\nframework, the electron clouds barely overlap; in covalent bonds, the\nelectron clouds are shared, and thus the nuclei are very close together.\nThus, for **condensed phases** (solids and liquids), one can simply plug\nin $\\sigma$, the temperature, and the other constants, and out pops the\npair potential! Moreover, for solids, this pair potential can be\nmultiplied by a factor of $6 \\times N_A$ where $N_A$ is Avogadro's\nnumber to get the **molar cohesive energy** of the solid! All from some\nknowledge of dipole moments, polarizabilities, and ionization energies.\n\n[^2.3.1]: A van der Waals solid is a solid held together by van der\n    Waals---as opposed to covalent---bonds.\n",

However, we know\nfrom experience that there must be other forces which prevent objects\nfrom smooshing into each other, never to be separated. The fundamental\nforce that prevents objects from passing through each other arises from\nthe **Pauli exclusion principle**, which says that no two\nparticles---electrons in our case---with the same quantum numbers can\noccupy the same physical space. Thus, the electrons in your hand\ninteracting with the electrons in your keyboard, your phone, or this\nbook produce a strong repulsive force at very small separations.\n\nWe have learned that the attractive forces arising from the van der\nWaals potential energies fall off with separation at a rate proportional\nto $\\frac{1}{r^6}$.

Double bonds are about 50% higher than that, in\ntotal, because there are two bonds instead of one. However, in chemistry\nwe are used to talking about moles of things---$10^{23}$\nparticles---which is not always useful in nanoengineering.\n\nOne reason that nanoengineers and physicists wouldn't want to use moles\nin calculations is that we are often interested in the interaction of a\nsingle molecule to a surface, or the binding of a single nanoparticle to\na cell (or a small handful of these interactions). So, we use units for\nenergy that are much smaller than what we have been trained to think\nabout in a chemistry class. The strength of a covalent or ionic bond on\na *per bond basis* is on the order of $10^{-19}$ J. These numbers are so\nabsurdly small that we introduce a new unit, **the thermal energy**\n$k_{B}T$, or usually just $kT$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant\n($1.38\\times10^{-23}$ J K$^{-1}$) and $T$ is the temperature, by\nconvention taken as 298K (25 $^{\\circ}$ C, unless noted otherwise). So,\n$kT=4.01\\times10^{-21}$ J.\n\nThus, the energy of a covalent or ionic bond is now on the order of 100\n$kT$ and that of a van der Waals bond is 1 $kT$ (like methane, CH $_{4}$\n, or argon, Ar). For an especially strong noncovalent bond, like a\nhydrogen bond, the energy may go as high as 10 $\\times kT$, which makes\nsense, because water is a liquid at room temperature. A good rule of\nthumb is that if the intermolecular **pair potential**---van der Waals\nenergy at separation $\\sigma$---is $\\geq 10 kT$, then there is a good\nchance that this species is a liquid or a solid (a *condensed phase*) at\nroom temperature.\n\nUsing units of $kT$ gives us nice numbers, like 1, 10, and 100, without\nneeding to consider the huge negative exponents. Conveniently, it also\nhappens that the strength of a bond between molecules in units of $kT$\nis the same order of magnitude as the strength of all the bonds in a\nmole of molecules in units of kJ mol$^{-1}$. So, a covalent bond has an\nenergy of around 100 $kT$ per atom and around 100 kJ mol$^{-1}$ (order\nof magnitude only). In terms of forces, a covalent or ionic bond can be\nseparated by around 1 nN (mnemonic: nanoengineering, nanonewton). The\nforce needed to separate a strong hydrogen bond is around 100 pN, and\nthat needed to separate a normal van der Waals bond in contact is around\n10 pN.\n",

These non-covalent bonds have their bases in\nelectrostatics and quantum mechanics, but give rise to much of the\nbehavior of matter which does not involve the movement or sharing of\nelectrons between atoms. These interactions are also responsible for\nmolecular self-assembly and much of the complexity of biological\nsystems. In the biased opinion of the authors, they are perhaps the most\nunderappreciated energetic interactions in all of the sciences and\nengineering. They control phase changes, latent heat, dynamics of\nmultiparticle systems, and dominate the the properties of most forms of\norganic matter. (In an alternate universe, there would be whole\nundergraduate degrees in the consequences of intermolecular forces that\ngive rise to noncovalent bonds. However, in our own universe,\nchemistry---i.e., the study of the formation of *covalent* bonds---ended\nup being the subject that most high school students take.) In the next\nchapter, we will take what we have learned about forces between atoms\nand molecules and apply them to forces between nanoparticles and\nmacroscopic objects and surfaces.\n",
