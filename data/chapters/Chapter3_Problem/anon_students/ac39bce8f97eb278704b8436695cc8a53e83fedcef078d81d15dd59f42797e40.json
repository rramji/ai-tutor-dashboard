The thing is, when it comes to Cvdw , it is related to electron polarizability, which is proportional to volume^2. Density is m/v, and in this case it is squared, so it contains 1/v^2. The v^2 from Cvdw and the 1/v^2 from p^2 cancel each other out. So that makes the volume of the objects essentially a non-factor in the Hamakar constant, which explains why the shapes of the materials don't really matter for that - volume is cancelled out.

The term v^2 from Cvdw and the term 1/v^2 from p^2 cancel out. Volume canceling out directly cancels out anything to do with the shape of the objects or how much space they take up- effectively making the shape irrelevent in A.
