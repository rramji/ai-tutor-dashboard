This causes the soap to be slippery to other soap. Soap is made up of a hydrophilic and hydrophobic end. The hydrophobic end bonds with the oils on your hands and the hydrophilic sides bond with the water that you use to wash the soap off. Before the soap is washed off, there is a thin layer of soap that can stay on your hand due to the attraction of the hydrophobic end to the oil while the EDL forces of the soap prevents new soap from clumping and creating a mountain of soap on your hand.

When water is applied, the interaction between your hands and the bar of soap is similar to that of a colloid.

This means that each soap particle feels a repulsive force to the others when water is applied which causes them to slide off of each other and act slippery. When it comes to your hand, there is an attractive force between your hand and the soap on its surface which keeps the two bonded so that when new soap particles arrive, they slip off of those bonded to the hand, which is why it is easy for a bar of soap to slip out of your hand in the shower but not when you buy it.
