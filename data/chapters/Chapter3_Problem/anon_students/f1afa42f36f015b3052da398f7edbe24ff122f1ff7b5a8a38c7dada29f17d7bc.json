The sulfate ions that make up the hydrophilic heads are oriented towards the water, while the long hydrocarbon tail is bound to the skin. The sodium counter-ions that are part of the sodium dodecyl sulfate molecule forms a diffuse layer around the sulfate ions.  When you rub your hands, the hydrophobic tails attach to each skin surface while the hydrophilic sulfate heads point towards the water between the fingers. The Sodium ions then form diffuse layers around the sulfate heads. However, if the sulfate ions get too close to the skin, or the surface of any material it is interacting with, the counter-ions will be more confined and less microstates and less entropy, which is an unfavorable state. Thus, the repulsive force EDL arises in order to lower the energy of the system by pushing the soap away from the surface so that the counter-ions have greater degrees of freedom and the system has greater entropy. Another factor that results in the slippery feel of soap is the viscosity of the soap and water. The viscosity of these two substances creates a thin fluid layer because it allows the fluid to fill into the rough patches on the surfaces, smoothening it would. When trying to move the surfaces, the fluid resists rapid changes in its shape which creates a persistent layer between the surfaces and reduces direct contact. The reduction of direct contact causes the soap to be slippery. ",

There are rough patches that decrease the contact area when trying to fuse 2 halves of a broken solid together. However, it can be achieved through the perfect alignment of the surfaces so that the rough patches are also perfectly aligned. This helps because through perfect alignment the surface contours are matched precisely, where each atom is lined up exactly.  It, therefore, reduces \u201cdead space\u201d and interfacial gaps between atoms,  and allows for more interacting atoms. Thus, maximizes contact area. In addition, with the atoms being lined up perfectly there is better interaction between electron clouds, resulting in a higher likelihood for an induced dipole to form. This maximization of contact area and better interaction of electron clouds results in  strong VDW forces. This pressure can also be achieved through the usage of soft matter that is more pliable and flexible, and therefore, has less rough patches and greater contact area. ",

      "content": "Soap feels slippery because of the repulsive EDL forces. The sulfate ions that make up the hydrophilic heads are oriented towards the water, while the long hydrocarbon tail is bound to the skin. The sodium counter-ions that are part of the sodium dodecyl sulfate molecule forms a diffuse layer around the sulfate ions.  When you rub your hands, the hydrophobic tails attach to each skin surface while the hydrophilic sulfate heads point towards the water between the fingers. The Sodium ions then form diffuse layers around the sulfate heads. However, if the sulfate ions get too close to the skin, or the surface of any material it is interacting with, the counter-ions will be more confined and less microstates and less entropy, which is an unfavorable state. Thus, the repulsive force EDL arises in order to lower the energy of the system by pushing the soap away from the surface so that the counter-ions have greater degrees of freedom and the system has greater entropy. Another factor that results in the slippery feel of soap is the viscosity of the soap and water. The viscosity of these two substances creates a thin fluid layer because it allows the fluid to fill into the rough patches on the surfaces, smoothening it would. When trying to move the surfaces, the fluid resists rapid changes in its shape which creates a persistent layer between the surfaces and reduces direct contact. The reduction of direct contact causes the soap to be slippery. ",

This is because when bringing the 2 NP together, the polymers attached are confined and don't have as many degrees of freedom. This is a low entropy state, which is unfavorable. To increase energy of a system and decrease  entropy, a repulsive force arises that pushes the NP away so the polymers have more degrees of freedom. This repulsive force serves as a counter to the VDW forces as it allows particles to become further apart and weakens the VDW attractive forces. This prevents aggregation and allows the colloid to remain stable. This is important because aggregation will result in less nanoparticles being formed but rather them being merged together which can increase the size and size confinement no longer has the same effects.",
