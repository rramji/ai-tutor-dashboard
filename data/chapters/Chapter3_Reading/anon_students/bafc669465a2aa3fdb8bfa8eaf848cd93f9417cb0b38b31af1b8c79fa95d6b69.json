      "content": "#### Section 1: Interparticle and intersurface forces: the missing link\nWhen I was a student, I thought that van der Waals forces were relevant\nonly to atoms and molecules. It didn't occur to me that the concepts of\ndipole-dipole and London dispersion forces applied to small particles,\nto say nothing of large objects like fingertips and construction\nmaterials. Well, such forces absolutely manifest on this large, \"human,\"\nscale. Here, we will learn how to calculate the forces between\nnanoparticles and large surfaces. We will learn the relative strengths\nof these forces, how to engineer them to make stable systems of\nnanoparticles, and a bit of the theory as to how they operate. For a\nvideo primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/CfMqxMJRfkc)\n\nAs much as I enjoyed thinking about atoms, molecules, and reactions\nbetween them in my classes as a chemistry major in college, a part of me\nfound these courses unsatisfying. The dictionary definition of chemistry\nis \"the study of the structure and properties of matter, and the changes\nthat it undergoes.\" However, endless acid-base titrations, Lewis dot\nstructures, and balancing equations didn't seem to come close to\nexplaining the \"properties of matter.\" I wanted to know how ants and\nspiders stuck to the ceiling, why superglue didn't work under water, and\nhow my body didn't congeal despite my cells being 30% solids. You know,\nthe stuff that most teenagers think about.\n\nIn order to answer these questions, one needs to know not about covalent\ninteractions---i.e., chemistry---but of *noncovalent* ones. While\nchemistry classes make us think that chemical reactions are happening\nall the time, it's pretty rare that we observe them in action. (Of\ncourse chemical reactions are at the core of chemical manufacturing and\nare ubiquitous in biological systems. Cooking involves some chemical\nchange, but even something as simple as cooking an egg---denaturing its\nproteins using heat---involves noncovalent interactions.) Indeed, most\n\"everyday phenomena\" are based on noncovalent interactions. When I was a\nhigh school and college student, I knew something was missing from my\nchemistry curriculum, but I quite literally didn't know what it was.\n\nSure, we were all taught about van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and\nthe other interactions that formed the basis of Chapter 2. But it didn't\nseem that they had anything to do with real life. I knew that van der\nWaals forces existed between atoms and molecules, and were responsible\nat least for the forces between atoms of noble gases, like helium and\nargon. But did van der Waals forces exist between objects you could\ntouch? Is the sticky feeling of tape or your skin on a hot day the\nresult of van der Waals force? Or is it something else? If van der Waals\nforces are so weak---argon is a gas, after all---then what explains the\nhardness of hard candy, which are supposedly held together by nothing\nbut van der Waals forces (so-called \"van der Waals'' solids)?\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Van der Waals forces between particles and surfaces\nIt is a relatively simple conceptual jump to go from forces between\nions, atoms, and molecules to forces between nanoparticles (and even\nmacroscopic objects). In order to obtain the potential energies and\nforces between objects larger than atoms and molecules, we have to add\nup all the individual forces between the atoms or molecules that make up\nthe larger particles. To do this, we start by assuming that each atom or\nmolecule interacts with every atom or molecule in the opposing particle.\nWe use integral calculus[^3.2.1] to add up all the forces, and get an\nequation in terms of the van der Waals coefficient, $C_{VDW}$.\n\n### 3.2.1. Interactions involving curved objects\n\nIt is often useful to know the interaction energies between surfaces\ncontaining one or more curved surfaces: spheres, hemispheres, and things\nthat can be approximated as such. Given the spherical shapes of atoms,\nit may be tempting to just take equations (2.3), (2.6), and (2.7) and\nscale by the number of particles in each object. Unfortunately, this\nwill give us the wrong answer. The reason is that the centers of the\nobjects might be centimeters or meters away from each other. Thus, the\nvast majority of atoms in any macroscopic surface contribute effectively\nzero to the van der Waals interaction. Such potential energies fall off\nto essentially nothing after only a few tens of nanometers.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible to derive equations for the interaction\nenergies for most geometries of particles one is likely to encounter.\nFor example, below is the equation for the energy between two spherical\nparticles of equal radii, made of the same material.\n\n(Equation 3.1) $$W(D)=-\\frac{\\pi^2C_{VDW}\\rho^2R}{12D}$$\n\nwhere $W(D)$ is the interaction potential energy and $D$ is the distance\nbetween the surfaces of the particles. We use a big $W$ as opposed to a\nsmall $w$ to emphasize that these are energies between particles much\nlarger than atoms and molecules, and we use $D$ as the *separation\nbetween the surfaces*. We do not use $r$, the center-to-center distance,\nbecause the centers of two nanoscopic or macroscopic objects could be\nvery far from the surfaces, and do not contribute much to the total\nenergy. Note that the interaction energy falls off as $1/D$ rather than\nthe inverse factor of $r^6$ we saw for the van der Waals energy for\nindividual atoms and molecules (i.e., $1/r^6$). Thus, the interaction\nbetween surfaces particles maintains its strength for relative large\ndistances.\n\n### 3.2.2. The Hamaker constant\n\nThe terms for density, $\\pi$, and the van der Waals coefficient,\n$C_{VDW}$, appear so often in these equations that we define a new\nquantity, the Hamaker constant, $A$, which contains all of these\nquantities:\n\n(Equation 3.2) $$A=\\pi^2C_{VDW}\\rho^2$$\n\nThus, the equation for the energy between two identical spheres can be\nwritten as\n\n(Equation 3.3) $$W(D)=-\\frac{AR}{12D}$$\n\nEach Hamaker constant comes from a unique combination of three different\nmaterials: two of which are the two objects interacting, and the third\nis the medium in which the interaction occurs (e.g., air, vacuum,\nwater). For example, two silicon dioxide nanoparticles interacting in\nwater would have the Hamaker constant $A$ $_{SiO_2-H_2O-SiO_2}$ ,\nregardless of the size or shape of the particles. How do we go about\ncalculating the Hamaker constant, $A$? The answer is that we don't; we\nlook it up in a table. There are only a fairly limited number of Hamaker\nconstants that nanoengineers could possibly care about: particles of\nsilicon, gold, silver, copper, platinum, organic nanoparticles, etc.,\ninteracting in air, vacuum, water, or in a solvent.\n\nThus, the use of $A$ instead of various factors of $C_{VDW}$, $\\pi$, and\n$\\rho$ greatly simplifies the expressions for energies between objects\nlarger than molecules. Most Hamaker constants are on the order of\n10$^{-19}$ J in air or vacuum. The reason the Hamaker constant doesn't\nvary that much between materials is that the equation for $A$ contains\ntwo competing criteria: the van der Waals coefficient, $C_{VDW}$, and\nthe density $\\rho$. $C_{VDW}$ is proportional to the square of the\nelectronic polarizability, which is proportional to the square of the\nvolume. On the other hand, $\\rho$ is proportional to the inverse of the\nvolume. When $\\rho$ is squared in equation (3.2), you get something\nproportional to the inverse of the square of the volume. So, the two\nterms roughly cancel out and you end up with some factor times\n10$^{-19}$.\n\n### 3.2.3. Converting energy to forces between surfaces\n\nAs objects get bigger and start looking more like engineering systems\nthan like chemical systems, we tend to become more interested in\n*forces* rather than *energies*. In Chapter 2, we defined the force as\nthe negative rate of change of the energy with respect to interparticle\nseparation. Using this relationship between force and energy as before,\nequation (2.2), convince yourself that the force can be written as\n\n(Equation 3.4) $$F(D)_{sphere-sphere}=-\\frac{AR}{12D^2}$$\n\nThe energy of a sphere interacting with a flat surface arises often in\nnanoengineering. The round object can also be taken to be the radius of\ncurvature of a tip, or some microscopic bit of roughness.\n\n(Equation 3.5) $$W(D)_{sphere-surface}=-\\frac{AR}{6D}$$\n\nAs a homework assignment, see if you can derive the equation for the\nforce from equation (3.5).\n\n### 3.2.4. Interactions between flat objects\n\nFinally, consideration of the energy of two flat surfaces interacting\nyields:\n\n(Equation 3.6)\n$$W(D)_{flat-flat}=-\\frac{A}{12 \\pi D^2} \\text{ per unit area}$$\n\nPlease note that the equation for the two flat surfaces above has units\nof *energy per unit area*. That is, a two-dimensional energy density.\nWhen converted to force, we have force per unit area, which is also\ncalled pressure:\n\n(Equation 3.7) $$F(D)_{flat-flat}=P(D)=-\\frac{A}{6\\pi D^{3}}$$\n\nEquations (3.6) and (3.7) are profound in the following sense: if the\ntwo interacting surfaces are made of the same material, then equation\n(3.6) represent the *cohesive energy density* per cross sectional area\nof the material. Then, equation (3.7) is the *cohesive pressure* of two\npieces of material with perfectly smooth surfaces. For a typical van der\nWaals solid like a piece of hard candy, the cohesive pressure is\nhuge---on the order of 1,000 atmospheres! Now, of course, if you have\ntwo broken pieces of hard candy and, assuming they are not sticky due to\nhumidity or high temperature, try to stick them together, they probably\nwill not stick very well. Or, certainly not with 1,000 atmospheres of\npressure! On the other hand, if you take an intact piece of hard candy\nand attempt to break it apart with two pairs of pliers---*without\nbending it*---you will find that it is almost impossible. The reason it\nwill not fuse together if already broken but will be nearly impossible\nto break apart if initially unbroken is not because the two scenarios\nare operating under different force laws. The reason is that when\nputting two pieces together, all it takes is one little nanoscale\nprotrusion or defect for the whole surface to be misaligned. If this\nmisalignment happens, the probability of every molecule on one surface\nbeing *in van der Waals contact* with a molecule on the other surface is\nvanishingly small. Thus, we don't achieve nearly the adhesive pressure\npredicted by equation (3.7).\n\nAs a preview to the next chapter, the energy per unit area as shown in\nequation (3.6), comes up a lot. In particular, this quantity is two\ntimes the **surface energy density** of the two surfaces after they are\nbroken apart. If the material is a liquid, the surface energy density\nhas the same value as the **surface tension**, which is responsible for\na range of phenomena, from the spherical shape of water droplets in the\nsky, to the capillarity responsible for flow in rapid antigen tests for\nthe coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to the mechanism by which water\nstriders and other animals \"walk on water.\"\n\n### 3.2.5. Summary of particle geometries\n\nThe scenarios described in equations (3.3) through (3.7) should cover\n\\>90% of scenarios you are likely to encounter in your career in\nnanoengineering, and 100% of the scenarios you will encounter in this\ncourse. Figure (3.1) depicts these scenarios.\n\n(Figure 3.1) \n>>>image(VDW surfaces.png.0)\n\n[^3.2.1]: Don't let this word scare you if you haven't taken calculus.\n    Integrals in this context are just summations of individual\n    interactions\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Electric double layer forces\nYou might wonder why---since van der Waals forces are attractive---any\nsolution or suspension of nanoparticles like paint or milk can be stable\nat all. In fact, human cells are something like 30% solid material! If\nvan der Waals forces are attractive and ubiquitous, why does not all of\nthis solid material just clump up, sink to the bottom, or float to the\ntop, as the case may be? The reason is that in such suspensions, there\nare repulsive forces that prevent aggregation or coagulation of the\nparticles. One of these forces is the **electric double layer force\n(EDL)**, which occurs between all nanoparticles and surfaces in any\naqueous environment. Stated briefly and expanded upon below, the EDL\nforce arises because of a repulsive interaction of entropic origin. A\ndiffuse layer of **counterions** surrounds charged particles that are\nimmersed in water. Compression of these diffuse layers when two charged\nparticles are brought close together, as we will see, results in a\nrepulsive force, which keeps the particles from clumping together.\n\n### 3.3.1. Origin of the EDL force\n\nThe EDL force arises because of the entropic repulsion of clouds of ions\nwhich surround charged particles or surfaces. In aqueous media, any\nsurface placed inside will take on charges which are fixed to the\nsurface. These surface charges are called **co-ions**. The charge of\neach co-ion is counterbalanced by a **counterion**. This pairing ensures\nelectrical neutrality of the entire system (that is, the bound charges\nat the surface and the counterions have opposite signs). For example,\nwhen solid particles covered in --NH $_{2}$ groups are placed in an\naqueous solution, the basic nitrogen atom (specifically its lone pair)\nsucks some number of H atoms from water. This acid-base reaction\nproduces positively charged surfaces (-NH$_{3}^{+}$) and negatively\ncharged counterions (OH$^{-}$). When the solid particles are really\nclose, such that the outside surfaces of the particles can be\napproximated as two giant parallel plates, the OH$^{-}$ groups repel\nfrom each other against the sides of the solid particles.[^3.3.1] In\nsolution at a finite temperature, entropy will ensure that the OH$^{-}$\ncounterions diffuse some short distance away from the surface bearing\nthe positive charge. When the large surfaces get closer together, the\ndiffuse clouds of counterions get squeezed and the individual OH$^{-}$\nions have less room to move around (Figure (3.2)). Entropically, this\nsituation is unfavorable, so there is a net repulsive force between the\nsurfaces. This force gets stronger with a greater surface charge density\n(more counterions). On the other hand, the force gets weaker with\nincreasing electrolyte (i.e., salt) concentration in the solution.\n\n(Figure 3.2) \n>>>image(EDL.png.0)\n\nOur treatment of the EDL force is going to be largely qualitative in\nthis course. Suffice it to say that for every equation for the van der\nWaals interaction involving spheres interacting with spheres, spheres\ninteracting with flat surfaces, etc., there is a corresponding equation\nfor the EDL interaction. These expressions get very complicated for our\npurposes (they contain, for example, the highly unusual *tanh* function)\nand will not be discussed here. While we will not present any equations,\nwe will say that the equations for the EDL interactions depend on the\nsurface charge density and the electrolyte concentration in solution.\nOnce calculated, they return values in units of energy (J) or force (N).\nTo get the total energy of interaction which includes both VDW and EDL\ncontributions, you just add them up (see Section (3.4)).\n\n### 3.3.2. The Debye length\n\nThe characteristic thickness of the diffuse layer of counterions is\ncalled the **Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$**. The Debye length is a\nmeasure of how rapidly away from the surface the halo of counterions\ndecays. It is not a measure of how many ions are in the cloud to begin\nwith. Recall that the fundamental reason the EDL interaction is\nrepulsive is because of the entropic unfavorability of confining this\nlayer of counterions. That is, when these layers get pinched---as in the\napproach of two particles---the ions lose degrees of freedom. The\nrepulsive force that results can be increased in one of two ways. The\nfirst way is to pinch the halo of counterions even more so when the\nparticles come nearly into contact (thus reducing the entropy of the\nlayer in the final state). The second way is to make the layer around\neach particle thicker to begin with (thus increasing the entropy of the\ninitial state). The easiest way to tune the thickness of the counterion\nlayer is by adjusting the electrolyte (i.e., salt) concentration in the\nmedium.\n\n#### Reducing the EDL repulsion by \"salting out\"\n\nThe salt concentration in the medium has a direct effect on the\nthickness of the counterion layer surrounding each surface in water.\nJust like the origin of the repulsive force, the reason is entropic.\nConsider the reason why the layer of counterions is diffuse to begin\nwith. Pure electrostatics would predict that the counterions in the gap\nbetween particles would be pushed away from each other as far as\npossible. Just as the extra electrons on a conductor push each other\napart so that they are all at the surface (think of a steel ball bearing\nwith a lot of extra electrons), the counterions in gaps between surfaces\npush each other apart. The fact that we are in a liquid medium at a\nfinite temperature encourages the counterions to drift a little bit away\nfrom the surfaces (i.e., entropy). Hold that thought.\n\nNow, consider the addition of a bunch of extra ions---both positive and\nnegative, as in Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$---into the solution. With all\nthose extra ions around, *there are many more ways that the original\nlayer of counterions could remain pushed apart, pinned to the opposing\nsurfaces*, as predicted by electrostatics alone. So, there is a\nre-balancing between the driving force of electrostatics (which want the\ncounterions to be pushed in a very thin layer toward the surface) and\nentropy (which want the counterions to be as diffuse as possible). More\nsalt in solution means more microstates, overall, so there is less of an\nentropic benefit for the counterions to form a diffuse layer. Thus, they\nbecome more and more pinned to the opposing surface, and the Debye\nlength shrinks. As the counterion layer becomes thinner, the EDL force\nbecomes weaker. If the EDL force becomes weak enough, the van der Waals\nforce will dominate, and the surfaces will be attracted to each other on\naverage. This situation is called an **unstable colloid** and the\nprocess of making colloids precipitate by increasing the electrolyte\nconcentration is called \"salting out.\" The balance between EDL forces\nand VDW forces is analyzed using DLVO theory, as described in the next\nsection.[^3.3.2]\n\n[^3.3.1]: In introductory electromagnetism, you will learn or have learned\n    that charges in a metallic object---such as a ball bearing---try to\n    get as far away from each other as possible by going to the surface.\n    The same thing is happening in the case of the OH$^{-}$ ions.\n\n[^3.3.2]: A note on terminology: a \"colloid\" is the whole suspension,\n    including the solvent. A \"colloidal particle\" is a single particle.\n",

This leads to particles clumping together and potentially settling out of the solution. It's called \"unstable\" because the particles no longer remain dispersed in the liquid. Is this concept clear now?",

      "content": "I see. Let me try to explain differently:\n\nIn a stable colloid, particles float separately in the liquid. In an unstable colloid, particles stick together, forming larger clumps. These clumps might sink or float, separating from the liquid.\n\nThink of oil droplets in water - they eventually separate. That's an unstable colloid.\n\nDoes this help clarify?",
