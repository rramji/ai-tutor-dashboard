      "content": "#### Section 2: Van der Waals forces between particles and surfaces\nIt is a relatively simple conceptual jump to go from forces between\nions, atoms, and molecules to forces between nanoparticles (and even\nmacroscopic objects). In order to obtain the potential energies and\nforces between objects larger than atoms and molecules, we have to add\nup all the individual forces between the atoms or molecules that make up\nthe larger particles. To do this, we start by assuming that each atom or\nmolecule interacts with every atom or molecule in the opposing particle.\nWe use integral calculus[^3.2.1] to add up all the forces, and get an\nequation in terms of the van der Waals coefficient, $C_{VDW}$.\n\n### 3.2.1. Interactions involving curved objects\n\nIt is often useful to know the interaction energies between surfaces\ncontaining one or more curved surfaces: spheres, hemispheres, and things\nthat can be approximated as such. Given the spherical shapes of atoms,\nit may be tempting to just take equations (2.3), (2.6), and (2.7) and\nscale by the number of particles in each object. Unfortunately, this\nwill give us the wrong answer. The reason is that the centers of the\nobjects might be centimeters or meters away from each other. Thus, the\nvast majority of atoms in any macroscopic surface contribute effectively\nzero to the van der Waals interaction. Such potential energies fall off\nto essentially nothing after only a few tens of nanometers.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible to derive equations for the interaction\nenergies for most geometries of particles one is likely to encounter.\nFor example, below is the equation for the energy between two spherical\nparticles of equal radii, made of the same material.\n\n(Equation 3.1) $$W(D)=-\\frac{\\pi^2C_{VDW}\\rho^2R}{12D}$$\n\nwhere $W(D)$ is the interaction potential energy and $D$ is the distance\nbetween the surfaces of the particles. We use a big $W$ as opposed to a\nsmall $w$ to emphasize that these are energies between particles much\nlarger than atoms and molecules, and we use $D$ as the *separation\nbetween the surfaces*. We do not use $r$, the center-to-center distance,\nbecause the centers of two nanoscopic or macroscopic objects could be\nvery far from the surfaces, and do not contribute much to the total\nenergy. Note that the interaction energy falls off as $1/D$ rather than\nthe inverse factor of $r^6$ we saw for the van der Waals energy for\nindividual atoms and molecules (i.e., $1/r^6$). Thus, the interaction\nbetween surfaces particles maintains its strength for relative large\ndistances.\n\n### 3.2.2. The Hamaker constant\n\nThe terms for density, $\\pi$, and the van der Waals coefficient,\n$C_{VDW}$, appear so often in these equations that we define a new\nquantity, the Hamaker constant, $A$, which contains all of these\nquantities:\n\n(Equation 3.2) $$A=\\pi^2C_{VDW}\\rho^2$$\n\nThus, the equation for the energy between two identical spheres can be\nwritten as\n\n(Equation 3.3) $$W(D)=-\\frac{AR}{12D}$$\n\nEach Hamaker constant comes from a unique combination of three different\nmaterials: two of which are the two objects interacting, and the third\nis the medium in which the interaction occurs (e.g., air, vacuum,\nwater). For example, two silicon dioxide nanoparticles interacting in\nwater would have the Hamaker constant $A$ $_{SiO_2-H_2O-SiO_2}$ ,\nregardless of the size or shape of the particles. How do we go about\ncalculating the Hamaker constant, $A$? The answer is that we don't; we\nlook it up in a table. There are only a fairly limited number of Hamaker\nconstants that nanoengineers could possibly care about: particles of\nsilicon, gold, silver, copper, platinum, organic nanoparticles, etc.,\ninteracting in air, vacuum, water, or in a solvent.\n\nThus, the use of $A$ instead of various factors of $C_{VDW}$, $\\pi$, and\n$\\rho$ greatly simplifies the expressions for energies between objects\nlarger than molecules. Most Hamaker constants are on the order of\n10$^{-19}$ J in air or vacuum. The reason the Hamaker constant doesn't\nvary that much between materials is that the equation for $A$ contains\ntwo competing criteria: the van der Waals coefficient, $C_{VDW}$, and\nthe density $\\rho$. $C_{VDW}$ is proportional to the square of the\nelectronic polarizability, which is proportional to the square of the\nvolume. On the other hand, $\\rho$ is proportional to the inverse of the\nvolume. When $\\rho$ is squared in equation (3.2), you get something\nproportional to the inverse of the square of the volume. So, the two\nterms roughly cancel out and you end up with some factor times\n10$^{-19}$.\n\n### 3.2.3. Converting energy to forces between surfaces\n\nAs objects get bigger and start looking more like engineering systems\nthan like chemical systems, we tend to become more interested in\n*forces* rather than *energies*. In Chapter 2, we defined the force as\nthe negative rate of change of the energy with respect to interparticle\nseparation. Using this relationship between force and energy as before,\nequation (2.2), convince yourself that the force can be written as\n\n(Equation 3.4) $$F(D)_{sphere-sphere}=-\\frac{AR}{12D^2}$$\n\nThe energy of a sphere interacting with a flat surface arises often in\nnanoengineering. The round object can also be taken to be the radius of\ncurvature of a tip, or some microscopic bit of roughness.\n\n(Equation 3.5) $$W(D)_{sphere-surface}=-\\frac{AR}{6D}$$\n\nAs a homework assignment, see if you can derive the equation for the\nforce from equation (3.5).\n\n### 3.2.4. Interactions between flat objects\n\nFinally, consideration of the energy of two flat surfaces interacting\nyields:\n\n(Equation 3.6)\n$$W(D)_{flat-flat}=-\\frac{A}{12 \\pi D^2} \\text{ per unit area}$$\n\nPlease note that the equation for the two flat surfaces above has units\nof *energy per unit area*. That is, a two-dimensional energy density.\nWhen converted to force, we have force per unit area, which is also\ncalled pressure:\n\n(Equation 3.7) $$F(D)_{flat-flat}=P(D)=-\\frac{A}{6\\pi D^{3}}$$\n\nEquations (3.6) and (3.7) are profound in the following sense: if the\ntwo interacting surfaces are made of the same material, then equation\n(3.6) represent the *cohesive energy density* per cross sectional area\nof the material. Then, equation (3.7) is the *cohesive pressure* of two\npieces of material with perfectly smooth surfaces. For a typical van der\nWaals solid like a piece of hard candy, the cohesive pressure is\nhuge---on the order of 1,000 atmospheres! Now, of course, if you have\ntwo broken pieces of hard candy and, assuming they are not sticky due to\nhumidity or high temperature, try to stick them together, they probably\nwill not stick very well. Or, certainly not with 1,000 atmospheres of\npressure! On the other hand, if you take an intact piece of hard candy\nand attempt to break it apart with two pairs of pliers---*without\nbending it*---you will find that it is almost impossible. The reason it\nwill not fuse together if already broken but will be nearly impossible\nto break apart if initially unbroken is not because the two scenarios\nare operating under different force laws. The reason is that when\nputting two pieces together, all it takes is one little nanoscale\nprotrusion or defect for the whole surface to be misaligned. If this\nmisalignment happens, the probability of every molecule on one surface\nbeing *in van der Waals contact* with a molecule on the other surface is\nvanishingly small. Thus, we don't achieve nearly the adhesive pressure\npredicted by equation (3.7).\n\nAs a preview to the next chapter, the energy per unit area as shown in\nequation (3.6), comes up a lot. In particular, this quantity is two\ntimes the **surface energy density** of the two surfaces after they are\nbroken apart. If the material is a liquid, the surface energy density\nhas the same value as the **surface tension**, which is responsible for\na range of phenomena, from the spherical shape of water droplets in the\nsky, to the capillarity responsible for flow in rapid antigen tests for\nthe coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to the mechanism by which water\nstriders and other animals \"walk on water.\"\n\n### 3.2.5. Summary of particle geometries\n\nThe scenarios described in equations (3.3) through (3.7) should cover\n\\>90% of scenarios you are likely to encounter in your career in\nnanoengineering, and 100% of the scenarios you will encounter in this\ncourse. Figure (3.1) depicts these scenarios.\n\n(Figure 3.1) \n>>>image(VDW surfaces.png.0)\n\n[^3.2.1]: Don't let this word scare you if you haven't taken calculus.\n    Integrals in this context are just summations of individual\n    interactions\n",
