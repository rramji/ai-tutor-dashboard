      "content": "#### Section 1: Surface Tension\nAtoms and molecules \"like\" interacting with their neighbors. When they\nget stranded at the surface, they have a high potential energy and want\nto retreat into the bulk to lower it. This tendency for molecules to\n\"dive\" down causes the surface to contract with a force called the\n**surface tension**. The surface tension is responsible for a wide range\nof phenomena, from the wicking of liquids paper-based diagnostic tests\nfor pregnancy and viral infection, to the stickiness of your clothes to\nyour skin on a humid day. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/ohp3gDKnjeo)\n\nWhen we think about van der Waals interactions, we usually think about\nthe small forces exerted by atoms and molecules on one another. In the\nlast chapter, we learned that these interactions can be summed up to\ncalculate forces between surfaces, be they surfaces of nanoparticles or\nsurfaces of macroscopic objects. The consequences of these summed up\nforces are easiest to visualize when considering systems of interacting\nsolid particles. In solids, the atoms are pretty much static. They do\nnot exchange freely between the surface and the bulk. Atoms on the\nsurface are stuck there, with their unsatisfied valencies unfulfilled.\n\nIn liquids, however, atoms are more or less free to go back and forth\nbetween the surface and the bulk. Naturally, they would prefer to be in\nthe bulk, so that they can maximize their van der Waals attraction with\neach other, and thus minimize their potential energy. One of the\nconsequences of the preference for atoms and molecules in a liquid to go\nfrom the surface into the bulk is a type of force called **surface\ntension**. Surface tension arises due to the unfavorable energy of atoms\nand molecules which live at the liquid-air interface (see Figure (4.1)).\nThat is, molecules have higher potential energy at the surface than the\ndo in the depth (the \"bulk\") of the liquid. The drive for molecules to\nreduce their potential energies by diving down into the bulk generates a\nforce that acts to contract the surface. Just as before, the force is\nthe negative rate of change (derivative) of the potential energy with\nrespect to some geometric change. Thus, since the potential energy\nincreases as the surface expands, there is a negative force which\n\"tries\" to shrink the surface. This force is the surface tension, and\nits consequences can be profound on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 4.1) \n>>>image(unhappy molecules.png.0)\n\n### 4.1.1. Relationship between surface tension and surface energy\n\nOverall, the potential energy of atoms or molecules increases as they go\nfrom the bulk to the surface. Conversely, the potential energy of these\natoms can be decreased by submerging themselves into the bulk. This\ntendency acts to decrease the surface area, and is the cause of the\nsurface tension, $\\gamma_{LG}$, often just referred to as $\\gamma$. For\nliquids, the surface tension is related to the Hamaker constant $A$ by\nequation (4.1).\n\n(Equation 4.1) $$\\gamma = \\frac{A}{24\\pi D^{2}}$$\n\nRecall the definition of the Hamaker constant, $A$, in equation (3.2).\nAlso notice that the right hand side of equation (4.1) is half the van\nder Waals energy between two flat interfaces given by (3.6). This energy\nis often called the **cohesive energy** because it represents the energy\nneeded to pull two flat interfaces apart. I know what you're thinking.\nSurface tension---equation (4.1)---is a force while half the van der\nWaals energy given by equation (3.6) would still be an energy! It turns\nout that the units of energy per unit area can be reduced to force per\nunit length, as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{Nm}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}}$$\n\nThus, equation (4.1) gives *both* the surface tension and the **surface\nenergy density** or just **surface energy**, for liquids. While a liquid\ncan have both a surface tension and a surface energy, a solid can have\nonly a surface energy, see Figure (4.2).[^4.1.1] The surface energy, again,\nis one half the cohesive energy of a solid. It represents the potential\nenergy of a surface due to all of the unsatisfied van der Waals bonds\nthat the atoms and molecules used to have with the atoms and molecules\nin the other surface. In liquids, which have both a surface tension and\na surface energy, the values are identical, but the units are different.\nFor example, consider the case of water at standard temperature and\npressure. In this case, the surface tension is 72 mN m$^{-1}$ while the\nsurface energy density is 72 mJ m$^{-2}$ (at room temperature).[^4.1.2]\n\n(Figure 4.2) \n>>>image(tension vs energy.png.0)\n\nSo, given the connection between the surface tension (or surface energy)\nand the Hamaker constant shown in equation (4.1), it is now possible to\ncalculate the surface tension from the dipole moment and\npolarizabilities of individual atoms and molecules! The surface tension\nis profoundly important in nanoengineering (and biology). Its importance\narises because small forces acting over small distances can have\ndramatic effects on small objects. For example, surface tension is\nresponsible for the wetting behavior of liquids on hydrophobic surfaces\n(think Rain-X, a product which makes rain bead up on car windshields);\ntransport of liquids in small tubes and porous materials; the stickiness\nof grains of sand to make sandcastles; the adhesion of particles of\npre-cured mortar, concrete, and stucco; and effects due to the **Laplace\npressure**, as we discuss in the next paragraph.\n\n### 4.1.2. Laplace pressure\n\nThe **Laplace pressure** is the pressure inside a bubble or a droplet in\nexcess of the surrounding pressure, which arises due to surface tension.\nThe concept applies to bubbles of a gas inside a liquid, droplets of one\ntype of liquid (e.g., oil/water) inside another type of liquid (e.g.,\nwater/oil) where the liquids are immiscible, and menisci of liquids that\nform at interfaces between solids and gases. In each case, the surface\ntension generates an overall force in the direction of the concave\ninterface (see figure below for visualization). This force manifests as\na pressure, as shown in equation (4.2).\n\n(Equation 4.2) $$P=\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\n\nWhere $P$ is the pressure in the droplet in excess of the atmospheric\npressure, $\\gamma$ is the surface tension, and $R$ is the radius of the\nbubble or droplet. For droplets with spheroidal geometries, the equation\nis (4.3), where R$_1$ and R$_2$ are the two semi-major axes.\n\n(Equation 4.3) $$P=\\gamma (\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2})$$\n\nThus, the pressures inside bubbles and droplets are always larger than\nthe pressures in the surrounding medium. For spherical bubbles and\ndroplets, the pressure can become quite large in droplets with small\ndiameters. For example, for a bubble with a radius of 1 $\\mu$m, the\nLaplace pressure is 145 kPa, or more than one additional atmosphere of\npressure. Figure (4.3) shows the direction the Laplace pressure acts to\ncompress bubbles and droplets, and to expand menisci.\n\n(Figure 4.3) \n>>>image(laplace pressure.png.0)\n\n### 4.1.3. Contact angle\n\nYou've probably noticed that liquid droplets either bead up or spread,\ndepending on the identity of the liquid and the solid surface on which\nit sits. For example, water beads up when it is sprinkled on plastic\ndishes, but tends to spread when it is sprinkled on ceramic ones.\nAlcohol like ethanol (CH $_{3}$ CH $_{2}$ OH, the \"alcohol\" in adult\nbeverages) or isopropyl alcohol (the alcohol used as a topical\ndisinfectant) has less of an ability to form hydrogen bonds compared to\nwater and thus spreads out on many surfaces. Gasoline, a mixture of\nmostly nonpolar hydrocarbons, spreads out even more. Conversely,\nmercury---a metal which is liquid at room temperature---has strong\nmetallic bonds and really unfavorable energy of the atoms at the surface\ncompared to those in the bulk. Mercury thus beads into nearly spherical\nballs on almost any surface. The diagrams shown in Figure (4.4) depict a\ncross section of the **static contact angle** for liquids and substrates\nwith different surface tensions and surface energies.\n\n(Figure 4.4) \n>>>image(contact angle.png.0)\n\nThe surface tension and surface energy depend on the strength of the\nintermolecular forces. As discussed in chapter (2), these forces depend\non the dipole moments and polarizabilities of the atoms and molecules\nthat make up the solid. Whether a liquid droplet spreads out\n(**wetting** behavior) or beads up (**non-wetting** behavior) depends on\na force balance at the **triple interface**. The triple interface is the\nperimeter of circle circumscribing the contact area of the liquid with\nthe surface. \"Triple\" refers to the fact that there are three\ninterfaces: liquid-gas, liquid-solid, and solid-gas. Thus, there are\nalso three interfacial energy densities: $\\gamma_{LG}, \\gamma_{LS},$ and\n$\\gamma_{SG}$. Equilibrium is reached when the interfacial energies\nbalance out, as shown in Figure (4.5).\n\n(Figure 4.5) \n>>>image(triple interface.png.0)\n\nWhat comes out of this analysis is a quantity called the **contact\nangle**, which is measured using a **goniometer**[^4.1.3], which is\nbasically a protractor inside a microscope. The contact angle $\\theta$\nis sometimes stated casually as a property of a material: \"the contact\nangle of polyethylene is $60^{\\circ}$\" means that the contact angle of\n*water* on a planar surface of the material measured in *air* is\n$60^{\\circ}$. One should note that the resulting contact angle would be\ndifferent for a different liquid measured in a different surrounding\nmedium. Generally, air and vacuum will produce the same result, because\nair has such a low density, it is effectively vacuum from the standpoint\nof the water droplet. The contact angle that a droplet of liquid makes\nwith a surface is given by equation (4.4)\n\n(Equation 4.4)\n$$\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{\\gamma_{SG}-\\gamma_{SL}}{\\gamma_{LG}}$$\n\nWhere $\\theta$ is the contact angle, $\\gamma_{SG}$ is the surface energy\nof the solid-air interface, $\\gamma_{SL}$ is the interfacial adhesive\nenergy between the solid and the liquid, and $\\gamma_{LG}$ is the\nsurface tension (or interfacial energy) of the liquid. Equation (4.4) is\nknown as the **Young** equation.\n\n[^4.1.1]: While the concept of surface tension applies to liquids, whose\n    molecules can move around fairly freely, it does not apply to\n    solids, whose molecules are stuck in place: the atoms in the bulk\n    are not free to exchange with those at the surface. Also, there are\n    elastic forces due to strong interactions between atoms in the bulk\n    that would overwhelm the surface tension. The surface tension would\n    be very weak compared to the elastic force exerted by a solid\n    material under deformation.\n\n[^4.1.2]: Joules and meters live in the \"MKS\" system of units (meters,\n    kilograms, seconds). In the world of \"cgs\" units, the values do not\n    change---72 dyn cm$^{-1}$, or 72 erg cm$^{-2}$. Pretty convenient!\n\n[^4.1.3]: Another of my favorite words in science\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Capillary interactions\nThe interplay of interfacial potential energies gives rise to a set of\nphenomena called **capillary interactions**. Capillary interactions\nderive their name from the tendency of a liquid to rise up in a narrow\ntube against the force of gravity. This tendency comes in part from the\nfavorable van der Waals interactions of the liquid with the interior of\nthe tube. However, there are a number of phenomena beside rise of liquid\nin a tube that nevertheless arise from the same fundamental\nintermolecular interactions. For example, the \"container\" need not be a\ntube; a piece of tissue paper also transports liquid by capillary\naction. Moreover, the bridging of small amounts of liquid between\nsurfaces can cause attraction which can be quite strong. For example,\nsuch **capillary forces** can be as strong as van der Waals forces\nbetween surfaces. Moreover, unlike van der Waals forces, forces arising\nfrom capillary interactions tend to retain their strength even when the\nsurfaces are rough, since the liquid conforms to the surface relief\nstructures.\n\n### 4.2.1. Capillary rise\n\nThe sticky feeling of your skin in humid weather, along with the\nstickiness of moistened grains of sand, can be explained by the concept\nof capillary force. Capillary forces arise from the same physics that\ngovern the rise of liquid in a thin glass tube, and the wicking of water\ninto paper (as in a rapid antigen test for COVID-19). The rise of a\nliquid column in a capillary tube can be predicted by an energy balance\nbetween the weight of the column of the water (pulling the water down)\nand the driving force for the water to cover the hydrophilic glass\nsurface (pushing the water up, see Figure (4.6)). The resulting equation\nis called **Jurin's law**, equation (4.5), below.\n\n(Figure 4.6) \n>>>image(capillary rise.png.0)\n\n(Equation 4.5) $$h=\\frac{2\\gamma_{LG} cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}$$\n\nHere, $h$ is the rise of the liquid in meters, $\\rho$ is the density of\nthe liquid in kg m$^{-3}$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8\nms$^{-2}$), and $r$ is the radius of the tube in meters. If the surface\nenergy of the interior of the tube is too low, or the surface energy of\nthe liquid is too high, the liquid will not rise very high, and may even\ngo below the surface of the surrounding liquid. This result is obtained,\nfor example, when the tube is made of Teflon and the liquid is\nmercury.[^4.2.1]\n\n### 4.2.2. Capillary attraction\n\nWhat do you need to make a sand castle? Sand and water. How much water?\nOf course, dry sand does not stick together. However, we know from\nexperience that if we submerge a sandcastle, it will quickly become a\nheap of wet sand. So, there must be something about the mixture of air\nand water that generates the cohesive energy of a sand castle. It turns\nout, that when slightly moist (or in humid environments), solid surfaces\ndevelop a thin film of water on them. When objects are brought close\ntogether, these thin films of water join up, and create **capillary\nbridges**, Figure (4.7).\n\n(Figure 4.7) \n>>>image(capillary bridge.png.0)\n\nThese capillary bridges have concave menisci when viewed from the\nexterior. As the distance between the surfaces increases, the capillary\nbridges stretch out. To stretch out, more molecules are recruited to the\nsurface from the bulk. This transport of molecules takes work, and this\nwork manifests as a surface tension. The restoring force which results\nacts almost like a spring. It is also useful to think of capillary force\nas another manifestation of the Laplace pressure. In fact, the pressure\ninside a liquid bridge is lower than the exterior pressure, just as the\npressure inside a bubble or droplet is greater than the exterior\npressure. The force acting to advance the surface is again in the\ndirection of the concave interface. So, the force pushes liquid bridges\nto expand, while it pushes bubbles and droplets to compress. Factors\nthat increase the strength of the capillary force are surface tension of\nthe liquid (often water), surface energy of the solid, and the ambient\nrelative humidity.\n\nThis last point led to an interesting debate in the literature in the\nearly 2000s. The question was the mechanism by which the feet of geckos\nstuck to solid surfaces. (You would think that this question had been\nlong since settled. Alas.) A gecko's toe pad has hairs called **setae**\nof a few microns in diameter, while the setae are themselves are divided\ninto even smaller structures called **spatulae**, so called because they\nlook like the tool of a short-order cook. These structures are made of\nkeratin, a type of exterior structural protein also found in mammalian\nhair and fingernails. At first, it was believed that van der Waals\nforces were the sole contributor to the overall adhesion of gecko feet\nto trees. Then, a paper was published that found a strong increase in\nthe adhesive strength with increasing relative humidity. This finding\npointed strongly to the presence of capillary forces (i.e., because\nincreasing humidity makes capillary bridges bigger). However, increasing\nhumidity can *also* affect the mechanical properties of polymeric\nmaterials like proteins. In particular, humid environments make polymers\nmore gummy by getting into the bulk structure and plasticizing it. Thus,\nit was ultimately found that the reason the adhesion of gecko feet to\nsolid structures increases with increasing humidity is that the keratin\nin the gecko's toes become stickier. Incidentally, sticky tape works by\nthis same principle: sticky polymers are sticky because the mechanical\nwork applied to separate the tape from a surface is directed into\nstretching the polymer molecules apart. You will find that much of\nengineering involves directing work into dissipative pathways.[^4.2.2]\n\n[^4.2.1]: Teflon, or polytetrafluorethylene, has a very low polarizability\n    due to the tightness with which fluorine holds its electrons. Thus,\n    it doesn't form strong van der Waals bonds with other materials.\n    Mercury, a metal which is a liquid at room temperature, has an\n    exceptionally high surface tension because of the strength of\n    metallic bonding. Atoms of mercury prefer to bind with themselves\n    and thus droplets of mercury appear to \"ball up\" like a sphere when\n    deposited on most surfaces.\n\n[^4.2.2]: *Dissipation* is the word we use where energy originating from a\n    single event---e.g., a footstep---gets converted to a bunch of\n    different forms of energy: sound waves, molecular vibrations, heat,\n    breakage of little pieces of the floor or your shoe sole, etc. The\n    energy is conserved, it's just harder to keep track of where it all\n    goes in a dissipative process.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Capillary interactions\nThe interplay of interfacial potential energies gives rise to a set of\nphenomena called **capillary interactions**. Capillary interactions\nderive their name from the tendency of a liquid to rise up in a narrow\ntube against the force of gravity. This tendency comes in part from the\nfavorable van der Waals interactions of the liquid with the interior of\nthe tube. However, there are a number of phenomena beside rise of liquid\nin a tube that nevertheless arise from the same fundamental\nintermolecular interactions. For example, the \"container\" need not be a\ntube; a piece of tissue paper also transports liquid by capillary\naction. Moreover, the bridging of small amounts of liquid between\nsurfaces can cause attraction which can be quite strong. For example,\nsuch **capillary forces** can be as strong as van der Waals forces\nbetween surfaces. Moreover, unlike van der Waals forces, forces arising\nfrom capillary interactions tend to retain their strength even when the\nsurfaces are rough, since the liquid conforms to the surface relief\nstructures.\n\n### 4.2.1. Capillary rise\n\nThe sticky feeling of your skin in humid weather, along with the\nstickiness of moistened grains of sand, can be explained by the concept\nof capillary force. Capillary forces arise from the same physics that\ngovern the rise of liquid in a thin glass tube, and the wicking of water\ninto paper (as in a rapid antigen test for COVID-19). The rise of a\nliquid column in a capillary tube can be predicted by an energy balance\nbetween the weight of the column of the water (pulling the water down)\nand the driving force for the water to cover the hydrophilic glass\nsurface (pushing the water up, see Figure (4.6)). The resulting equation\nis called **Jurin's law**, equation (4.5), below.\n\n(Figure 4.6) \n>>>image(capillary rise.png.0)\n\n(Equation 4.5) $$h=\\frac{2\\gamma_{LG} cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}$$\n\nHere, $h$ is the rise of the liquid in meters, $\\rho$ is the density of\nthe liquid in kg m$^{-3}$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8\nms$^{-2}$), and $r$ is the radius of the tube in meters. If the surface\nenergy of the interior of the tube is too low, or the surface energy of\nthe liquid is too high, the liquid will not rise very high, and may even\ngo below the surface of the surrounding liquid. This result is obtained,\nfor example, when the tube is made of Teflon and the liquid is\nmercury.[^4.2.1]\n\n### 4.2.2. Capillary attraction\n\nWhat do you need to make a sand castle? Sand and water. How much water?\nOf course, dry sand does not stick together. However, we know from\nexperience that if we submerge a sandcastle, it will quickly become a\nheap of wet sand. So, there must be something about the mixture of air\nand water that generates the cohesive energy of a sand castle. It turns\nout, that when slightly moist (or in humid environments), solid surfaces\ndevelop a thin film of water on them. When objects are brought close\ntogether, these thin films of water join up, and create **capillary\nbridges**, Figure (4.7).\n\n(Figure 4.7) \n>>>image(capillary bridge.png.0)\n\nThese capillary bridges have concave menisci when viewed from the\nexterior. As the distance between the surfaces increases, the capillary\nbridges stretch out. To stretch out, more molecules are recruited to the\nsurface from the bulk. This transport of molecules takes work, and this\nwork manifests as a surface tension. The restoring force which results\nacts almost like a spring. It is also useful to think of capillary force\nas another manifestation of the Laplace pressure. In fact, the pressure\ninside a liquid bridge is lower than the exterior pressure, just as the\npressure inside a bubble or droplet is greater than the exterior\npressure. The force acting to advance the surface is again in the\ndirection of the concave interface. So, the force pushes liquid bridges\nto expand, while it pushes bubbles and droplets to compress. Factors\nthat increase the strength of the capillary force are surface tension of\nthe liquid (often water), surface energy of the solid, and the ambient\nrelative humidity.\n\nThis last point led to an interesting debate in the literature in the\nearly 2000s. The question was the mechanism by which the feet of geckos\nstuck to solid surfaces. (You would think that this question had been\nlong since settled. Alas.) A gecko's toe pad has hairs called **setae**\nof a few microns in diameter, while the setae are themselves are divided\ninto even smaller structures called **spatulae**, so called because they\nlook like the tool of a short-order cook. These structures are made of\nkeratin, a type of exterior structural protein also found in mammalian\nhair and fingernails. At first, it was believed that van der Waals\nforces were the sole contributor to the overall adhesion of gecko feet\nto trees. Then, a paper was published that found a strong increase in\nthe adhesive strength with increasing relative humidity. This finding\npointed strongly to the presence of capillary forces (i.e., because\nincreasing humidity makes capillary bridges bigger). However, increasing\nhumidity can *also* affect the mechanical properties of polymeric\nmaterials like proteins. In particular, humid environments make polymers\nmore gummy by getting into the bulk structure and plasticizing it. Thus,\nit was ultimately found that the reason the adhesion of gecko feet to\nsolid structures increases with increasing humidity is that the keratin\nin the gecko's toes become stickier. Incidentally, sticky tape works by\nthis same principle: sticky polymers are sticky because the mechanical\nwork applied to separate the tape from a surface is directed into\nstretching the polymer molecules apart. You will find that much of\nengineering involves directing work into dissipative pathways.[^4.2.2]\n\n[^4.2.1]: Teflon, or polytetrafluorethylene, has a very low polarizability\n    due to the tightness with which fluorine holds its electrons. Thus,\n    it doesn't form strong van der Waals bonds with other materials.\n    Mercury, a metal which is a liquid at room temperature, has an\n    exceptionally high surface tension because of the strength of\n    metallic bonding. Atoms of mercury prefer to bind with themselves\n    and thus droplets of mercury appear to \"ball up\" like a sphere when\n    deposited on most surfaces.\n\n[^4.2.2]: *Dissipation* is the word we use where energy originating from a\n    single event---e.g., a footstep---gets converted to a bunch of\n    different forms of energy: sound waves, molecular vibrations, heat,\n    breakage of little pieces of the floor or your shoe sole, etc. The\n    energy is conserved, it's just harder to keep track of where it all\n    goes in a dissipative process.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Surface Tension\nAtoms and molecules \"like\" interacting with their neighbors. When they\nget stranded at the surface, they have a high potential energy and want\nto retreat into the bulk to lower it. This tendency for molecules to\n\"dive\" down causes the surface to contract with a force called the\n**surface tension**. The surface tension is responsible for a wide range\nof phenomena, from the wicking of liquids paper-based diagnostic tests\nfor pregnancy and viral infection, to the stickiness of your clothes to\nyour skin on a humid day. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/ohp3gDKnjeo)\n\nWhen we think about van der Waals interactions, we usually think about\nthe small forces exerted by atoms and molecules on one another. In the\nlast chapter, we learned that these interactions can be summed up to\ncalculate forces between surfaces, be they surfaces of nanoparticles or\nsurfaces of macroscopic objects. The consequences of these summed up\nforces are easiest to visualize when considering systems of interacting\nsolid particles. In solids, the atoms are pretty much static. They do\nnot exchange freely between the surface and the bulk. Atoms on the\nsurface are stuck there, with their unsatisfied valencies unfulfilled.\n\nIn liquids, however, atoms are more or less free to go back and forth\nbetween the surface and the bulk. Naturally, they would prefer to be in\nthe bulk, so that they can maximize their van der Waals attraction with\neach other, and thus minimize their potential energy. One of the\nconsequences of the preference for atoms and molecules in a liquid to go\nfrom the surface into the bulk is a type of force called **surface\ntension**. Surface tension arises due to the unfavorable energy of atoms\nand molecules which live at the liquid-air interface (see Figure (4.1)).\nThat is, molecules have higher potential energy at the surface than the\ndo in the depth (the \"bulk\") of the liquid. The drive for molecules to\nreduce their potential energies by diving down into the bulk generates a\nforce that acts to contract the surface. Just as before, the force is\nthe negative rate of change (derivative) of the potential energy with\nrespect to some geometric change. Thus, since the potential energy\nincreases as the surface expands, there is a negative force which\n\"tries\" to shrink the surface. This force is the surface tension, and\nits consequences can be profound on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 4.1) \n>>>image(unhappy molecules.png.0)\n\n### 4.1.1. Relationship between surface tension and surface energy\n\nOverall, the potential energy of atoms or molecules increases as they go\nfrom the bulk to the surface. Conversely, the potential energy of these\natoms can be decreased by submerging themselves into the bulk. This\ntendency acts to decrease the surface area, and is the cause of the\nsurface tension, $\\gamma_{LG}$, often just referred to as $\\gamma$. For\nliquids, the surface tension is related to the Hamaker constant $A$ by\nequation (4.1).\n\n(Equation 4.1) $$\\gamma = \\frac{A}{24\\pi D^{2}}$$\n\nRecall the definition of the Hamaker constant, $A$, in equation (3.2).\nAlso notice that the right hand side of equation (4.1) is half the van\nder Waals energy between two flat interfaces given by (3.6). This energy\nis often called the **cohesive energy** because it represents the energy\nneeded to pull two flat interfaces apart. I know what you're thinking.\nSurface tension---equation (4.1)---is a force while half the van der\nWaals energy given by equation (3.6) would still be an energy! It turns\nout that the units of energy per unit area can be reduced to force per\nunit length, as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{Nm}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}}$$\n\nThus, equation (4.1) gives *both* the surface tension and the **surface\nenergy density** or just **surface energy**, for liquids. While a liquid\ncan have both a surface tension and a surface energy, a solid can have\nonly a surface energy, see Figure (4.2).[^4.1.1] The surface energy, again,\nis one half the cohesive energy of a solid. It represents the potential\nenergy of a surface due to all of the unsatisfied van der Waals bonds\nthat the atoms and molecules used to have with the atoms and molecules\nin the other surface. In liquids, which have both a surface tension and\na surface energy, the values are identical, but the units are different.\nFor example, consider the case of water at standard temperature and\npressure. In this case, the surface tension is 72 mN m$^{-1}$ while the\nsurface energy density is 72 mJ m$^{-2}$ (at room temperature).[^4.1.2]\n\n(Figure 4.2) \n>>>image(tension vs energy.png.0)\n\nSo, given the connection between the surface tension (or surface energy)\nand the Hamaker constant shown in equation (4.1), it is now possible to\ncalculate the surface tension from the dipole moment and\npolarizabilities of individual atoms and molecules! The surface tension\nis profoundly important in nanoengineering (and biology). Its importance\narises because small forces acting over small distances can have\ndramatic effects on small objects. For example, surface tension is\nresponsible for the wetting behavior of liquids on hydrophobic surfaces\n(think Rain-X, a product which makes rain bead up on car windshields);\ntransport of liquids in small tubes and porous materials; the stickiness\nof grains of sand to make sandcastles; the adhesion of particles of\npre-cured mortar, concrete, and stucco; and effects due to the **Laplace\npressure**, as we discuss in the next paragraph.\n\n### 4.1.2. Laplace pressure\n\nThe **Laplace pressure** is the pressure inside a bubble or a droplet in\nexcess of the surrounding pressure, which arises due to surface tension.\nThe concept applies to bubbles of a gas inside a liquid, droplets of one\ntype of liquid (e.g., oil/water) inside another type of liquid (e.g.,\nwater/oil) where the liquids are immiscible, and menisci of liquids that\nform at interfaces between solids and gases. In each case, the surface\ntension generates an overall force in the direction of the concave\ninterface (see figure below for visualization). This force manifests as\na pressure, as shown in equation (4.2).\n\n(Equation 4.2) $$P=\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\n\nWhere $P$ is the pressure in the droplet in excess of the atmospheric\npressure, $\\gamma$ is the surface tension, and $R$ is the radius of the\nbubble or droplet. For droplets with spheroidal geometries, the equation\nis (4.3), where R$_1$ and R$_2$ are the two semi-major axes.\n\n(Equation 4.3) $$P=\\gamma (\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2})$$\n\nThus, the pressures inside bubbles and droplets are always larger than\nthe pressures in the surrounding medium. For spherical bubbles and\ndroplets, the pressure can become quite large in droplets with small\ndiameters. For example, for a bubble with a radius of 1 $\\mu$m, the\nLaplace pressure is 145 kPa, or more than one additional atmosphere of\npressure. Figure (4.3) shows the direction the Laplace pressure acts to\ncompress bubbles and droplets, and to expand menisci.\n\n(Figure 4.3) \n>>>image(laplace pressure.png.0)\n\n### 4.1.3. Contact angle\n\nYou've probably noticed that liquid droplets either bead up or spread,\ndepending on the identity of the liquid and the solid surface on which\nit sits. For example, water beads up when it is sprinkled on plastic\ndishes, but tends to spread when it is sprinkled on ceramic ones.\nAlcohol like ethanol (CH $_{3}$ CH $_{2}$ OH, the \"alcohol\" in adult\nbeverages) or isopropyl alcohol (the alcohol used as a topical\ndisinfectant) has less of an ability to form hydrogen bonds compared to\nwater and thus spreads out on many surfaces. Gasoline, a mixture of\nmostly nonpolar hydrocarbons, spreads out even more. Conversely,\nmercury---a metal which is liquid at room temperature---has strong\nmetallic bonds and really unfavorable energy of the atoms at the surface\ncompared to those in the bulk. Mercury thus beads into nearly spherical\nballs on almost any surface. The diagrams shown in Figure (4.4) depict a\ncross section of the **static contact angle** for liquids and substrates\nwith different surface tensions and surface energies.\n\n(Figure 4.4) \n>>>image(contact angle.png.0)\n\nThe surface tension and surface energy depend on the strength of the\nintermolecular forces. As discussed in chapter (2), these forces depend\non the dipole moments and polarizabilities of the atoms and molecules\nthat make up the solid. Whether a liquid droplet spreads out\n(**wetting** behavior) or beads up (**non-wetting** behavior) depends on\na force balance at the **triple interface**. The triple interface is the\nperimeter of circle circumscribing the contact area of the liquid with\nthe surface. \"Triple\" refers to the fact that there are three\ninterfaces: liquid-gas, liquid-solid, and solid-gas. Thus, there are\nalso three interfacial energy densities: $\\gamma_{LG}, \\gamma_{LS},$ and\n$\\gamma_{SG}$. Equilibrium is reached when the interfacial energies\nbalance out, as shown in Figure (4.5).\n\n(Figure 4.5) \n>>>image(triple interface.png.0)\n\nWhat comes out of this analysis is a quantity called the **contact\nangle**, which is measured using a **goniometer**[^4.1.3], which is\nbasically a protractor inside a microscope. The contact angle $\\theta$\nis sometimes stated casually as a property of a material: \"the contact\nangle of polyethylene is $60^{\\circ}$\" means that the contact angle of\n*water* on a planar surface of the material measured in *air* is\n$60^{\\circ}$. One should note that the resulting contact angle would be\ndifferent for a different liquid measured in a different surrounding\nmedium. Generally, air and vacuum will produce the same result, because\nair has such a low density, it is effectively vacuum from the standpoint\nof the water droplet. The contact angle that a droplet of liquid makes\nwith a surface is given by equation (4.4)\n\n(Equation 4.4)\n$$\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{\\gamma_{SG}-\\gamma_{SL}}{\\gamma_{LG}}$$\n\nWhere $\\theta$ is the contact angle, $\\gamma_{SG}$ is the surface energy\nof the solid-air interface, $\\gamma_{SL}$ is the interfacial adhesive\nenergy between the solid and the liquid, and $\\gamma_{LG}$ is the\nsurface tension (or interfacial energy) of the liquid. Equation (4.4) is\nknown as the **Young** equation.\n\n[^4.1.1]: While the concept of surface tension applies to liquids, whose\n    molecules can move around fairly freely, it does not apply to\n    solids, whose molecules are stuck in place: the atoms in the bulk\n    are not free to exchange with those at the surface. Also, there are\n    elastic forces due to strong interactions between atoms in the bulk\n    that would overwhelm the surface tension. The surface tension would\n    be very weak compared to the elastic force exerted by a solid\n    material under deformation.\n\n[^4.1.2]: Joules and meters live in the \"MKS\" system of units (meters,\n    kilograms, seconds). In the world of \"cgs\" units, the values do not\n    change---72 dyn cm$^{-1}$, or 72 erg cm$^{-2}$. Pretty convenient!\n\n[^4.1.3]: Another of my favorite words in science\n",

For example, the \"container\" need not be a\ntube; a piece of tissue paper also transports liquid by capillary\naction. Moreover, the bridging of small amounts of liquid between\nsurfaces can cause attraction which can be quite strong. For example,\nsuch **capillary forces** can be as strong as van der Waals forces\nbetween surfaces. Moreover, unlike van der Waals forces, forces arising\nfrom capillary interactions tend to retain their strength even when the\nsurfaces are rough, since the liquid conforms to the surface relief\nstructures.\n\n### 4.2.1. Capillary rise\n\nThe sticky feeling of your skin in humid weather, along with the\nstickiness of moistened grains of sand, can be explained by the concept\nof capillary force. Capillary forces arise from the same physics that\ngovern the rise of liquid in a thin glass tube, and the wicking of water\ninto paper (as in a rapid antigen test for COVID-19). The rise of a\nliquid column in a capillary tube can be predicted by an energy balance\nbetween the weight of the column of the water (pulling the water down)\nand the driving force for the water to cover the hydrophilic glass\nsurface (pushing the water up, see Figure (4.6)). The resulting equation\nis called **Jurin's law**, equation (4.5), below.\n\n(Figure 4.6) \n>>>image(capillary rise.png.0)\n\n(Equation 4.5) $$h=\\frac{2\\gamma_{LG} cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}$$\n\nHere, $h$ is the rise of the liquid in meters, $\\rho$ is the density of\nthe liquid in kg m$^{-3}$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8\nms$^{-2}$), and $r$ is the radius of the tube in meters. If the surface\nenergy of the interior of the tube is too low, or the surface energy of\nthe liquid is too high, the liquid will not rise very high, and may even\ngo below the surface of the surrounding liquid. This result is obtained,\nfor example, when the tube is made of Teflon and the liquid is\nmercury.[^4.2.1]\n\n### 4.2.2. Capillary attraction\n\nWhat do you need to make a sand castle? Sand and water. How much water?\nOf course, dry sand does not stick together. However, we know from\nexperience that if we submerge a sandcastle, it will quickly become a\nheap of wet sand. So, there must be something about the mixture of air\nand water that generates the cohesive energy of a sand castle. It turns\nout, that when slightly moist (or in humid environments), solid surfaces\ndevelop a thin film of water on them. When objects are brought close\ntogether, these thin films of water join up, and create **capillary\nbridges**, Figure (4.7).\n\n(Figure 4.7) \n>>>image(capillary bridge.png.0)\n\nThese capillary bridges have concave menisci when viewed from the\nexterior. As the distance between the surfaces increases, the capillary\nbridges stretch out. To stretch out, more molecules are recruited to the\nsurface from the bulk. This transport of molecules takes work, and this\nwork manifests as a surface tension. The restoring force which results\nacts almost like a spring. It is also useful to think of capillary force\nas another manifestation of the Laplace pressure. In fact, the pressure\ninside a liquid bridge is lower than the exterior pressure, just as the\npressure inside a bubble or droplet is greater than the exterior\npressure. The force acting to advance the surface is again in the\ndirection of the concave interface. So, the force pushes liquid bridges\nto expand, while it pushes bubbles and droplets to compress. Factors\nthat increase the strength of the capillary force are surface tension of\nthe liquid (often water), surface energy of the solid, and the ambient\nrelative humidity.\n\nThis last point led to an interesting debate in the literature in the\nearly 2000s. The question was the mechanism by which the feet of geckos\nstuck to solid surfaces. (You would think that this question had been\nlong since settled. Alas.) A gecko's toe pad has hairs called **setae**\nof a few microns in diameter, while the setae are themselves are divided\ninto even smaller structures called **spatulae**, so called because they\nlook like the tool of a short-order cook. These structures are made of\nkeratin, a type of exterior structural protein also found in mammalian\nhair and fingernails. At first, it was believed that van der Waals\nforces were the sole contributor to the overall adhesion of gecko feet\nto trees. Then, a paper was published that found a strong increase in\nthe adhesive strength with increasing relative humidity. This finding\npointed strongly to the presence of capillary forces (i.e., because\nincreasing humidity makes capillary bridges bigger). However, increasing\nhumidity can *also* affect the mechanical properties of polymeric\nmaterials like proteins. In particular, humid environments make polymers\nmore gummy by getting into the bulk structure and plasticizing it. Thus,\nit was ultimately found that the reason the adhesion of gecko feet to\nsolid structures increases with increasing humidity is that the keratin\nin the gecko's toes become stickier. Incidentally, sticky tape works by\nthis same principle: sticky polymers are sticky because the mechanical\nwork applied to separate the tape from a surface is directed into\nstretching the polymer molecules apart. You will find that much of\nengineering involves directing work into dissipative pathways.[^4.2.2]\n\n[^4.2.1]: Teflon, or polytetrafluorethylene, has a very low polarizability\n    due to the tightness with which fluorine holds its electrons. Thus,\n    it doesn't form strong van der Waals bonds with other materials.\n    Mercury, a metal which is a liquid at room temperature, has an\n    exceptionally high surface tension because of the strength of\n    metallic bonding. Atoms of mercury prefer to bind with themselves\n    and thus droplets of mercury appear to \"ball up\" like a sphere when\n    deposited on most surfaces.\n\n[^4.2.2]: *Dissipation* is the word we use where energy originating from a\n    single event---e.g., a footstep---gets converted to a bunch of\n    different forms of energy: sound waves, molecular vibrations, heat,\n    breakage of little pieces of the floor or your shoe sole, etc. The\n    energy is conserved, it's just harder to keep track of where it all\n    goes in a dissipative process.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Surface Tension\nAtoms and molecules \"like\" interacting with their neighbors. When they\nget stranded at the surface, they have a high potential energy and want\nto retreat into the bulk to lower it. This tendency for molecules to\n\"dive\" down causes the surface to contract with a force called the\n**surface tension**. The surface tension is responsible for a wide range\nof phenomena, from the wicking of liquids paper-based diagnostic tests\nfor pregnancy and viral infection, to the stickiness of your clothes to\nyour skin on a humid day. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/ohp3gDKnjeo)\n\nWhen we think about van der Waals interactions, we usually think about\nthe small forces exerted by atoms and molecules on one another. In the\nlast chapter, we learned that these interactions can be summed up to\ncalculate forces between surfaces, be they surfaces of nanoparticles or\nsurfaces of macroscopic objects. The consequences of these summed up\nforces are easiest to visualize when considering systems of interacting\nsolid particles. In solids, the atoms are pretty much static. They do\nnot exchange freely between the surface and the bulk. Atoms on the\nsurface are stuck there, with their unsatisfied valencies unfulfilled.\n\nIn liquids, however, atoms are more or less free to go back and forth\nbetween the surface and the bulk. Naturally, they would prefer to be in\nthe bulk, so that they can maximize their van der Waals attraction with\neach other, and thus minimize their potential energy. One of the\nconsequences of the preference for atoms and molecules in a liquid to go\nfrom the surface into the bulk is a type of force called **surface\ntension**. Surface tension arises due to the unfavorable energy of atoms\nand molecules which live at the liquid-air interface (see Figure (4.1)).\nThat is, molecules have higher potential energy at the surface than the\ndo in the depth (the \"bulk\") of the liquid. The drive for molecules to\nreduce their potential energies by diving down into the bulk generates a\nforce that acts to contract the surface. Just as before, the force is\nthe negative rate of change (derivative) of the potential energy with\nrespect to some geometric change. Thus, since the potential energy\nincreases as the surface expands, there is a negative force which\n\"tries\" to shrink the surface. This force is the surface tension, and\nits consequences can be profound on the nanoscale.\n\n(Figure 4.1) \n>>>image(unhappy molecules.png.0)\n\n### 4.1.1. Relationship between surface tension and surface energy\n\nOverall, the potential energy of atoms or molecules increases as they go\nfrom the bulk to the surface. Conversely, the potential energy of these\natoms can be decreased by submerging themselves into the bulk. This\ntendency acts to decrease the surface area, and is the cause of the\nsurface tension, $\\gamma_{LG}$, often just referred to as $\\gamma$. For\nliquids, the surface tension is related to the Hamaker constant $A$ by\nequation (4.1).\n\n(Equation 4.1) $$\\gamma = \\frac{A}{24\\pi D^{2}}$$\n\nRecall the definition of the Hamaker constant, $A$, in equation (3.2).\nAlso notice that the right hand side of equation (4.1) is half the van\nder Waals energy between two flat interfaces given by (3.6). This energy\nis often called the **cohesive energy** because it represents the energy\nneeded to pull two flat interfaces apart. I know what you're thinking.\nSurface tension---equation (4.1)---is a force while half the van der\nWaals energy given by equation (3.6) would still be an energy! It turns\nout that the units of energy per unit area can be reduced to force per\nunit length, as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{Nm}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}}$$\n\nThus, equation (4.1) gives *both* the surface tension and the **surface\nenergy density** or just **surface energy**, for liquids. While a liquid\ncan have both a surface tension and a surface energy, a solid can have\nonly a surface energy, see Figure (4.2).[^4.1.1] The surface energy, again,\nis one half the cohesive energy of a solid. It represents the potential\nenergy of a surface due to all of the unsatisfied van der Waals bonds\nthat the atoms and molecules used to have with the atoms and molecules\nin the other surface. In liquids, which have both a surface tension and\na surface energy, the values are identical, but the units are different.\nFor example, consider the case of water at standard temperature and\npressure. In this case, the surface tension is 72 mN m$^{-1}$ while the\nsurface energy density is 72 mJ m$^{-2}$ (at room temperature).[^4.1.2]\n\n(Figure 4.2) \n>>>image(tension vs energy.png.0)\n\nSo, given the connection between the surface tension (or surface energy)\nand the Hamaker constant shown in equation (4.1), it is now possible to\ncalculate the surface tension from the dipole moment and\npolarizabilities of individual atoms and molecules! The surface tension\nis profoundly important in nanoengineering (and biology). Its importance\narises because small forces acting over small distances can have\ndramatic effects on small objects. For example, surface tension is\nresponsible for the wetting behavior of liquids on hydrophobic surfaces\n(think Rain-X, a product which makes rain bead up on car windshields);\ntransport of liquids in small tubes and porous materials; the stickiness\nof grains of sand to make sandcastles; the adhesion of particles of\npre-cured mortar, concrete, and stucco; and effects due to the **Laplace\npressure**, as we discuss in the next paragraph.\n\n### 4.1.2. Laplace pressure\n\nThe **Laplace pressure** is the pressure inside a bubble or a droplet in\nexcess of the surrounding pressure, which arises due to surface tension.\nThe concept applies to bubbles of a gas inside a liquid, droplets of one\ntype of liquid (e.g., oil/water) inside another type of liquid (e.g.,\nwater/oil) where the liquids are immiscible, and menisci of liquids that\nform at interfaces between solids and gases. In each case, the surface\ntension generates an overall force in the direction of the concave\ninterface (see figure below for visualization). This force manifests as\na pressure, as shown in equation (4.2).\n\n(Equation 4.2) $$P=\\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\n\nWhere $P$ is the pressure in the droplet in excess of the atmospheric\npressure, $\\gamma$ is the surface tension, and $R$ is the radius of the\nbubble or droplet. For droplets with spheroidal geometries, the equation\nis (4.3), where R$_1$ and R$_2$ are the two semi-major axes.\n\n(Equation 4.3) $$P=\\gamma (\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\frac{1}{R_2})$$\n\nThus, the pressures inside bubbles and droplets are always larger than\nthe pressures in the surrounding medium. For spherical bubbles and\ndroplets, the pressure can become quite large in droplets with small\ndiameters. For example, for a bubble with a radius of 1 $\\mu$m, the\nLaplace pressure is 145 kPa, or more than one additional atmosphere of\npressure. Figure (4.3) shows the direction the Laplace pressure acts to\ncompress bubbles and droplets, and to expand menisci.\n\n(Figure 4.3) \n>>>image(laplace pressure.png.0)\n\n### 4.1.3. Contact angle\n\nYou've probably noticed that liquid droplets either bead up or spread,\ndepending on the identity of the liquid and the solid surface on which\nit sits. For example, water beads up when it is sprinkled on plastic\ndishes, but tends to spread when it is sprinkled on ceramic ones.\nAlcohol like ethanol (CH $_{3}$ CH $_{2}$ OH, the \"alcohol\" in adult\nbeverages) or isopropyl alcohol (the alcohol used as a topical\ndisinfectant) has less of an ability to form hydrogen bonds compared to\nwater and thus spreads out on many surfaces. Gasoline, a mixture of\nmostly nonpolar hydrocarbons, spreads out even more. Conversely,\nmercury---a metal which is liquid at room temperature---has strong\nmetallic bonds and really unfavorable energy of the atoms at the surface\ncompared to those in the bulk. Mercury thus beads into nearly spherical\nballs on almost any surface. The diagrams shown in Figure (4.4) depict a\ncross section of the **static contact angle** for liquids and substrates\nwith different surface tensions and surface energies.\n\n(Figure 4.4) \n>>>image(contact angle.png.0)\n\nThe surface tension and surface energy depend on the strength of the\nintermolecular forces. As discussed in chapter (2), these forces depend\non the dipole moments and polarizabilities of the atoms and molecules\nthat make up the solid. Whether a liquid droplet spreads out\n(**wetting** behavior) or beads up (**non-wetting** behavior) depends on\na force balance at the **triple interface**. The triple interface is the\nperimeter of circle circumscribing the contact area of the liquid with\nthe surface. \"Triple\" refers to the fact that there are three\ninterfaces: liquid-gas, liquid-solid, and solid-gas. Thus, there are\nalso three interfacial energy densities: $\\gamma_{LG}, \\gamma_{LS},$ and\n$\\gamma_{SG}$. Equilibrium is reached when the interfacial energies\nbalance out, as shown in Figure (4.5).\n\n(Figure 4.5) \n>>>image(triple interface.png.0)\n\nWhat comes out of this analysis is a quantity called the **contact\nangle**, which is measured using a **goniometer**[^4.1.3], which is\nbasically a protractor inside a microscope. The contact angle $\\theta$\nis sometimes stated casually as a property of a material: \"the contact\nangle of polyethylene is $60^{\\circ}$\" means that the contact angle of\n*water* on a planar surface of the material measured in *air* is\n$60^{\\circ}$. One should note that the resulting contact angle would be\ndifferent for a different liquid measured in a different surrounding\nmedium. Generally, air and vacuum will produce the same result, because\nair has such a low density, it is effectively vacuum from the standpoint\nof the water droplet. The contact angle that a droplet of liquid makes\nwith a surface is given by equation (4.4)\n\n(Equation 4.4)\n$$\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{\\gamma_{SG}-\\gamma_{SL}}{\\gamma_{LG}}$$\n\nWhere $\\theta$ is the contact angle, $\\gamma_{SG}$ is the surface energy\nof the solid-air interface, $\\gamma_{SL}$ is the interfacial adhesive\nenergy between the solid and the liquid, and $\\gamma_{LG}$ is the\nsurface tension (or interfacial energy) of the liquid. Equation (4.4) is\nknown as the **Young** equation.\n\n[^4.1.1]: While the concept of surface tension applies to liquids, whose\n    molecules can move around fairly freely, it does not apply to\n    solids, whose molecules are stuck in place: the atoms in the bulk\n    are not free to exchange with those at the surface. Also, there are\n    elastic forces due to strong interactions between atoms in the bulk\n    that would overwhelm the surface tension. The surface tension would\n    be very weak compared to the elastic force exerted by a solid\n    material under deformation.\n\n[^4.1.2]: Joules and meters live in the \"MKS\" system of units (meters,\n    kilograms, seconds). In the world of \"cgs\" units, the values do not\n    change---72 dyn cm$^{-1}$, or 72 erg cm$^{-2}$. Pretty convenient!\n\n[^4.1.3]: Another of my favorite words in science\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Capillary interactions\nThe interplay of interfacial potential energies gives rise to a set of\nphenomena called **capillary interactions**. Capillary interactions\nderive their name from the tendency of a liquid to rise up in a narrow\ntube against the force of gravity. This tendency comes in part from the\nfavorable van der Waals interactions of the liquid with the interior of\nthe tube. However, there are a number of phenomena beside rise of liquid\nin a tube that nevertheless arise from the same fundamental\nintermolecular interactions. For example, the \"container\" need not be a\ntube; a piece of tissue paper also transports liquid by capillary\naction. Moreover, the bridging of small amounts of liquid between\nsurfaces can cause attraction which can be quite strong. For example,\nsuch **capillary forces** can be as strong as van der Waals forces\nbetween surfaces. Moreover, unlike van der Waals forces, forces arising\nfrom capillary interactions tend to retain their strength even when the\nsurfaces are rough, since the liquid conforms to the surface relief\nstructures.\n\n### 4.2.1. Capillary rise\n\nThe sticky feeling of your skin in humid weather, along with the\nstickiness of moistened grains of sand, can be explained by the concept\nof capillary force. Capillary forces arise from the same physics that\ngovern the rise of liquid in a thin glass tube, and the wicking of water\ninto paper (as in a rapid antigen test for COVID-19). The rise of a\nliquid column in a capillary tube can be predicted by an energy balance\nbetween the weight of the column of the water (pulling the water down)\nand the driving force for the water to cover the hydrophilic glass\nsurface (pushing the water up, see Figure (4.6)). The resulting equation\nis called **Jurin's law**, equation (4.5), below.\n\n(Figure 4.6) \n>>>image(capillary rise.png.0)\n\n(Equation 4.5) $$h=\\frac{2\\gamma_{LG} cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}$$\n\nHere, $h$ is the rise of the liquid in meters, $\\rho$ is the density of\nthe liquid in kg m$^{-3}$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8\nms$^{-2}$), and $r$ is the radius of the tube in meters. If the surface\nenergy of the interior of the tube is too low, or the surface energy of\nthe liquid is too high, the liquid will not rise very high, and may even\ngo below the surface of the surrounding liquid. This result is obtained,\nfor example, when the tube is made of Teflon and the liquid is\nmercury.[^4.2.1]\n\n### 4.2.2. Capillary attraction\n\nWhat do you need to make a sand castle? Sand and water. How much water?\nOf course, dry sand does not stick together. However, we know from\nexperience that if we submerge a sandcastle, it will quickly become a\nheap of wet sand. So, there must be something about the mixture of air\nand water that generates the cohesive energy of a sand castle. It turns\nout, that when slightly moist (or in humid environments), solid surfaces\ndevelop a thin film of water on them. When objects are brought close\ntogether, these thin films of water join up, and create **capillary\nbridges**, Figure (4.7).\n\n(Figure 4.7) \n>>>image(capillary bridge.png.0)\n\nThese capillary bridges have concave menisci when viewed from the\nexterior. As the distance between the surfaces increases, the capillary\nbridges stretch out. To stretch out, more molecules are recruited to the\nsurface from the bulk. This transport of molecules takes work, and this\nwork manifests as a surface tension. The restoring force which results\nacts almost like a spring. It is also useful to think of capillary force\nas another manifestation of the Laplace pressure. In fact, the pressure\ninside a liquid bridge is lower than the exterior pressure, just as the\npressure inside a bubble or droplet is greater than the exterior\npressure. The force acting to advance the surface is again in the\ndirection of the concave interface. So, the force pushes liquid bridges\nto expand, while it pushes bubbles and droplets to compress. Factors\nthat increase the strength of the capillary force are surface tension of\nthe liquid (often water), surface energy of the solid, and the ambient\nrelative humidity.\n\nThis last point led to an interesting debate in the literature in the\nearly 2000s. The question was the mechanism by which the feet of geckos\nstuck to solid surfaces. (You would think that this question had been\nlong since settled. Alas.) A gecko's toe pad has hairs called **setae**\nof a few microns in diameter, while the setae are themselves are divided\ninto even smaller structures called **spatulae**, so called because they\nlook like the tool of a short-order cook. These structures are made of\nkeratin, a type of exterior structural protein also found in mammalian\nhair and fingernails. At first, it was believed that van der Waals\nforces were the sole contributor to the overall adhesion of gecko feet\nto trees. Then, a paper was published that found a strong increase in\nthe adhesive strength with increasing relative humidity. This finding\npointed strongly to the presence of capillary forces (i.e., because\nincreasing humidity makes capillary bridges bigger). However, increasing\nhumidity can *also* affect the mechanical properties of polymeric\nmaterials like proteins. In particular, humid environments make polymers\nmore gummy by getting into the bulk structure and plasticizing it. Thus,\nit was ultimately found that the reason the adhesion of gecko feet to\nsolid structures increases with increasing humidity is that the keratin\nin the gecko's toes become stickier. Incidentally, sticky tape works by\nthis same principle: sticky polymers are sticky because the mechanical\nwork applied to separate the tape from a surface is directed into\nstretching the polymer molecules apart. You will find that much of\nengineering involves directing work into dissipative pathways.[^4.2.2]\n\n[^4.2.1]: Teflon, or polytetrafluorethylene, has a very low polarizability\n    due to the tightness with which fluorine holds its electrons. Thus,\n    it doesn't form strong van der Waals bonds with other materials.\n    Mercury, a metal which is a liquid at room temperature, has an\n    exceptionally high surface tension because of the strength of\n    metallic bonding. Atoms of mercury prefer to bind with themselves\n    and thus droplets of mercury appear to \"ball up\" like a sphere when\n    deposited on most surfaces.\n\n[^4.2.2]: *Dissipation* is the word we use where energy originating from a\n    single event---e.g., a footstep---gets converted to a bunch of\n    different forms of energy: sound waves, molecular vibrations, heat,\n    breakage of little pieces of the floor or your shoe sole, etc. The\n    energy is conserved, it's just harder to keep track of where it all\n    goes in a dissipative process.\n",

Let me clarify:\n\nThe contact angle is always measured through the liquid phase, from the solid surface.\n\nFor water (concave up \u222a):\n- Angle is <90\u00b0, but positive\n- Measured from tube wall, through water, to tangent line\n\nFor mercury (concave down \u2229):\n- Angle is >90\u00b0\n- Measured the same way\n\nDoes this help explain why water's angle isn't negative?",
