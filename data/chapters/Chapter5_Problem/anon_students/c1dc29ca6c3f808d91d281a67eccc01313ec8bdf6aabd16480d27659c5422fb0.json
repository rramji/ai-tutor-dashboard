Polypropylene indeed has some intermolecular forces, but are dipole-dipole forces dominant?\n\n2. Consider the structure of polypropylene. Does it have strong permanent dipoles?\n\n3. What other types of intermolecular forces might be present in polypropylene?\n\nCan you revise your answer considering these points?",
