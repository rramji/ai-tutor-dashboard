      "content": "#### Section 1: Introduction\nOrganic molecules comprise 99% of what we mean when we say \"molecules.\"\nThe ability to speak a few words of Organic---as in a language---is thus\nprofoundly valuable when engineering organic nanostructures. One type of\norganic nanostructure is a **polymer**. Polymers are long chains of\natoms, usually made of carbon and a few other elements. This is the\nfirst chapter in a series of three on polymers. Chapter 5 treats\npolymers as examples of organic nanostructures (as in vaccine delivery\nparticles), Chapter 6 treats them as the components of solid objects (as\nin a piece of plexiglass), and Chapter 7 covers some examples of\nelectronic polymers. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/v_5SYuuiyK4)\n\nOrganic structures play a central role in nanoengineering. They comprise\nall polymers (including all photoresists used in nanofabrication),\nliquid crystals, molecular dyes, and many of the additives used during\nthe growth of nanocrystals and quantum dots. Moreover, polymers are\nfound widely in biology and comprise most biological macromolecules:\npolypeptides, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. Almost every drug\nmolecule is an organic structure. Lucky for us, it is not necessary to\ntake an entire year of organic chemistry to learn what you need to know\nto be an effective nanoengineer. In fact, it's best not to even think of\nthis material as \"organic chemistry.\" Rather, you can think of it as\n*molecular structure and bonding*. It just so happens that most\nmolecules are made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and a few other\nsupporting players like sulfur and phosphorous, and thus considered\n\"organic.\"\n",
