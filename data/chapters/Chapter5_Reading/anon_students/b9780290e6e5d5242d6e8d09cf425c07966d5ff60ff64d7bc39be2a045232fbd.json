Unnatural organic structures can contain many other\nelements, such as chlorine (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) or bromine.\n\nThe site where non-carbon elements are incorporated into an organic\nmolecule is called a **functional group**. These groups are called\n*functional* because they often dictate the properties---thermodynamic\nproperties like melting and boiling point, along with chemical\nproperties like reactivity---of the molecule.

      "content": "#### Section 4: Chemical reactivity\nIn this course, we have taken a relaxed definition of the word \"bond\"\nsuch that it includes van der Waals bonds and other electrostatic\ninteractions. In this section, we will briefly mention the types of\nbonds that form in traditional chemical systems. That is, those that\ninvolve the movement or formal sharing or transfer of electrons.\n\n### 5.4.1. Electrostatic attraction and ionic bonding The most basic\ntype of bond is the one described in subsection (2.1.1). This is a\nclassic ionic bond between oppositely charged species that obeys\nCoulomb's law of electrostatic attraction. There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",

In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 5: Polymers as molecules and nanostructures\nPolymeric materials are ubiquitous in nanoengineering applications. For\nexample, as **photoresists** (the light-sensitive chemicals used in\nmicroelectronics fabrication), as **drug-delivery nanoparticles**, as\n**biomaterials** for regenerative medicine, as the charge-transport or\nencapsulation layers in **thin-film photovoltaic cells**, and as\ncomponents of **nanocomposite aerospace materials**. Compared to\ninorganic solids, polymers offer greater mechanical strength and\ntoughness, light weight, and synthetic tunability for biocompatibility,\nlight emission and absorption, chemical sensitivity, mechanical\ncompliance, and many other useful attributes.\n\nThere are two ways in which we can consider the properties of polymers.\nThe first way---discussed in this chapter---treats polymers as chemical\nobjects. That is, molecules or nanomaterials having properties like\ndipole moment, molecular weight, and polarizability. The second\nway---discussed in the next chapter---treats polymers as solid materials\nhaving bulk properties. That is, density, modulus, and conductivity.\n\n### 5.5.1. Structure of polymers\n\nExemplars of polymer synthesis are shown in Figure (5.4). Polymers are\nnamed after the monomer, whether or not something that looks like the\nmonomer is actually incorporated into the backbone of the polymer. For\nexample, in the synthesis of polyethylene, the monomer ethylene contains\na double bond, whereas the bonds in polyethylene are all single bonds.\nThe double bond in the monomer is needed because the electrons involved\nin the $\\pi$ bond of the double bond are needed to form the new single\nbond between monomers. Technically, the monomers are called **monomer\nresidues** once incorporated into the backbone of a polymer, though this\nword is used mostly by biologists in reference to **amino acid\nresidues** that make up the linear structure of proteins.\n\n#### Polyolefins\n\nThe polymers polyethylene and poly(methylmethacrylate) shown in Figure\n(5.4) are called **polyolefins**, which means that they are derived from\nthe rearrangement of the $\\pi$ bonds of double bonded monomers to form\nthe polymer.[^5.5.1] A characteristic of such polymers is that the backbone\n*contains nothing but carbon atoms!* Most polymers that look like this\nare made industrially by a **radical, cationic**, or **anionic\nmechanism**, we will not go through these mechanisms in detail. Suffice\nit to say, radical mechanisms operate by splitting the $\\pi$ bond of the\nmonomer into two individual electrons, which link up to form the new\nbonds. Cationic polymerizations are mediated by the movement of a\npositive charge, and anionic polymerizations are mediated by the\nmovement of a negative charge.\n\n#### Polycondensation reactions\n\nThere are other polymers, however, which contain *heteroatoms* in the\nbackbone, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon. Some of the\nmost well known examples of these heteroatom-containing polymers are\nderived from carbonyl compounds, and form polymer with the carbonyls\nintact. Examples of nitrogen-containing polymers that follow this\npattern are nylon and Kevlar (Figure (5.6), below).\n\n(Figure 5.6) \n>>>image(polyamide.png.0)\n\nExamples of oxygen-containing polymers that follow this pattern are\npolycarbonate (used in eyeglasses) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)\n(PET, a.k.a. polyester, used in clothing and soda bottles, Figure\n(5.7)).\n\n(Figure 5.7) \n>>>image(PET.png.0)\n\nThe chemical process by which such materials are synthesized is known as\n**polycondensation**, Figure (5.8). A polycondensation reaction follows\nthe general formula, shown below. The key is that a small molecule\n(often either water or hydrochloric acid) is ejected for every monomer\nthat joins the chain. The reaction is termed a *condensation* because\nthe molecular weight of the polymer chain is less than the weight of all\nthe monomers by the amount of this ejected monomer.\n\n(Figure 5.8) \n>>>image(polycondensation.png.0)\n\n[^5.5.1]: **Olefin** was the old-timey name for alkene, or carbon-carbon\n    double bond. One might have said so in the first place!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 6: Polymerization kinetics: Chain-growth and step-growth\nA polymer chain can grow one of two ways, by a **chain-growth** process\n(a.k.a. **addition**) or by a **step-growth** process (a.k.a.\n**condensation**). In chain-growth processes, one monomer adds one at a\ntime to the growing chain end: monomers react only with growing chain\nends. Monomers do not react with each other except upon **initiation**,\nand polymer chains do not react with each other, except upon\n**termination**. Chain-growth processes can be further subdivided into\n**uncontrolled** or **controlled** reaction types. In step-growth\nprocesses, every monomer and polymer is reactive toward every other\nmonomer and polymer in the mixture. The growth process of a polymer\ndetermines its distribution of molecular weight and has a profound\ninfluence on the applications to which it is suited.\n\n### 5.6.1. Chain-growth: Uncontrolled\n\nOf the 370 million metric tons (\"tonnes\") of polymers produced annually\naround the globe, the vast majority are polyolefins, and around half of\nthese are synthesized by (uncontrolled) free-radical polymerization.\nThese materials are dominated by polyethylene (plastic bags and milk\njugs), polypropylene (carpet), poly(vinyl chloride) (pipes, shower\ncurtains, LP records), and polystyrene (styrofoam, plastic petri\ndishes). We will not go into the mechanism here, but the reaction\nproceeds by what I think of as the *popcorn mechanism*. Picture all the\nmonomers in a big steel reactor. A radical initiator is sprinkled in.\nEach initiator molecule, at some random time, causes a chain reaction.\nOne monomer reacts with the next to form a dimer, the dimer reacts with\nanother monomer to form a trimer, the trimer reacts with another monomer\nto form a tetramer. This process repeats hundreds or thousands of times\nuntil it stops abruptly by colliding with another molecule. Some\npolymers stop at 100 monomers, some stop at 500 or 10,000. The number of\nmonomer residues in a polymer chain is called the **degree of\npolymerization**, $i$, and in free radical polymerizations it is a\nstatistical assortment of sort-of random chain lengths. This randomness\nleads to a large distribution of degrees of polymerization or\n**dispersity**.[^5.6.1]\n\nBecause of the randomness with which each polymer chain initiates and\nspeed with which it grows once commenced, the reaction mixture consists\nof unreacted monomers, along with fully formed polymer chains, with very\nfew partly formed polymers. Thus, the average molecular weight, $M_{n}$,\nof polymer chains---excluding unreacted monomers---is reached quickly. I\ncall uncontrolled chain growth the *popcorn mechanism* because at any\nlocation, you have either a piece of popcorn---a polymer chain---or an\nunpopped kernel---a monomer. The \"pops\" occur in random locations in the\nreaction mixture. A conceptual drawing showing the wide range in\ndistribution of molecular weights is shown in the following, Figure\n(5.9).\n\n(Figure 5.9) \n>>>image(uncontrolled.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.2. Chain-growth: Controlled or \"living\"\n\nA controlled chain-growth process is one in which the polymerization is\nslowed to an extent that all polymer chains initiate at around the same\ntime, and then monomers add a few at a time to each growing polymer\nchain. Often, this type of process is called **living** (Figure (5.10)),\nmeaning that once one type of monomer is consumed, a second type of\nmonomer can be added into the reaction mixture, which then adds to the\ngrowing polymer chains.\n\n(Figure 5.10) \n>>>image(living.png.0)\n\n#### Block copolymers\n\nThus, it is possible to make polymers with *blocks* of each type of\nmonomer residue. Such a structure is called a **block copolymer**.\nPolymers with the structure AAAABBBBB etc. are called **diblock**\ncopolymers, and those of the type AAAABBBBCCCC are called **triblock**\ncopolymers. While most **homopolymers**[^5.6.2] phase separate when mixed\n(like oil and water), block copolymers do not. In fact, while the \"A\"\nblocks and the \"B\" blocks of block copolymers might \"prefer\" to be\nseparated, they are covalently linked and thus prevented from doing so.\nInstead, they form nanostructures of \"A domains\" inside of a continuous\nphase of B, or vice-versa.[^5.6.3] Typically, block copolymers give the\n\"best of both worlds\" in properties held by either block alone. In\ncontrast, physical blends of the two polymers (without covalent\nattachment) tends to give an averaging of the properties, which leads to\nmaterials having the \"worst of both worlds\" (e.g., of, say, strength and\nchemical resistance). Block copolymers are useful for many things, such\nas porous films for separation membranes, low-dielectric films for\ngraphics processors, and as **thermoplastic elastomers**[^5.6.4] for 3D\nprinting, e.g., poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), or SBS rubber.\n\n### 5.6.3. Step-growth polymerization\n\nIn contrast to chain-growth polymerization, in which monomers add to\ngrowing chains one at a time, in a step-growth process, anything goes.\nThat is, a monomer has two reactive ends and can react with any monomer\nor any growing chain in the soup. So, a dimer can add to a dimer to make\na tetramer, two tetramers can add to form an octomer, and basically\nanything in the mix an add to anything else at any time. As a result of\nthis process, it takes a long time (percentage of reacted functional\ngroups) for polymers to form with large molecular weights. That is, it's\nnot until the last few reactions that 50-mers form 100-mers, 100-mers\nform 200-mers, and so on.[^5.6.5] For most of the reaction, you have mostly\nshort oligomers. At the end, you have long polymers. The rough plot of\n$M_{n}$ vs. % reacted functional groups for step-growth polymerization\nprocesses looks like the plot shown in Figure (5.11).\n\n(Figure 5.11) \n>>>image(step-growth.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.4. A word about molecular weight\n\nThe molecular weight of a polymer can be described in various ways, the\ntwo most popular of which are the **number-average molecular weight**,\n$M_{n}$, and the **weight-average molecular weight**, $M_{w}$. The\nformer, $M_{n}$, is the conventional average. To get $M_n$, we add up\nthe weight of the entire sample of polymer and divides by the number of\nchains, as in equation (5.1):\n\n(Equation 5.1) $$M_n=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i}{\\Sigma N_i}$$\n\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of polymers with degree of polymerization $i$\nand $M_i$ is the mass of the chain with degree of polymerization $i$.\nThis method of calculating the average molecular weight can be\nmisleading, however. This method of calculating the molecular weight\ntends to over-value the contributions of low-molecular-weight chains in\nthe sample, even though most of the actual mass of the sample is made of\nhigher molecular weight stuff. For example, if a sample consisted of two\npolymer chains, one with a mass of 20 and one with a mass of 2,000,000,\nthen $M_n$ would be about 1,000,000, but the properties would be\ndominated by the chain which occupied the largest fraction of the\nsample, by mass. In fact, it would behave almost identically to a sample\nwith $M_n$ of 2,000,000. To account for this misleading result of using\nonly the $M_n$ to characterize the sample, we use $M_w$. This value\ngives you a number that reflects the weights of the polymer chains that\nrepresent the largest fraction of the sample, as in equation (5.2)\n\n(Equation 5.2)\n$$M_w=\\frac{\\Sigma w_i M_i}{\\Sigma w_i}=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i^2}{\\Sigma N_i M_i}$$\n\nwhere $w_i$ is the weight of the entire sample with degree of\npolymerization $i$, or $N_iM_i$. Molecular weight (any type) has the\nunits of g mol$^{-1}$ or Dalton, Da.\n\n#### Dispersity\n\nThe dispersity is defined as =$\\frac{M_w}{M_n}$, which is always\n$\\geq$ 1. The larger the number , the larger the distribution of\nmolecular weights. In general, as we will find in the next chapter,\nlarger s mean less internal order, lower **glass transition\ntemperatures**, and greater mechanical compliance.\n\n### 5.6.5. Polymers as nanomaterials\n\nPolymers are one of the most fundamental types of nanostructured\nmaterials: a single polymer chain in solution is, fundamentally, a\nnanoparticle. The characteristic size of a polymer chain in solution is\ngiven by its **radius of gyration**, $R_g$, which can be thought of as\nthe average distance[^5.6.6] of the monomer residues from the center of mass\nof the polymer blob, which approximates a sphere. The $R_g$ can\neffectively be treated as a measure of the size of the polymer blob in\nsolution.\n\nThe volume of a polymer blob can be thought of in two different ways.\nThe first way is to calculate the volume taken up by the polymer blob,\nincluding the solvent molecules, or $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_g^3$. The second\nway is to calculate the volume of the polymer strand, which can be\nvisualized as a long cylinder, like a piece of spaghetti. This volume is\napproximately 10% of the volume of the polymer blob, which means that\nthe total volume occupied by the blob is actually 90% solvent!\n\nThe size of the blob depends on the solvent. In a \"good\" solvent, which\nhas favorable interactions with the monomer residues of the polymer, the\nblob expands. In a \"bad\" solvent, the monomer residues prefer\ninteracting with themselves (and/or the solvent molecules prefer\ninteracting with themselves instead of the polymer), and the blob\ncontracts. In the middle, we have a **theta solvent**, which is a\nsolvent that is good enough to \"cancel out\" the van der Waals forces\nbetween the monomer residues, and the size of the polymer blob is\nsomewhere in between what it would be in a good solvent on one side and\na bad solvent on the other. You can think of a theta solvent as being\n\"invisible\" to the polymer blob. That is, the polymer chain behaves as\nif there were no van der Waals forces between the residues. Because the\nentropy of a polymer in solution---and thus its solubility---depends on\ntemperature, any solvent can be turned into a theta solvent at a\nspecific temperature, known as the **theta temperature**.\n\n### 5.6.6. Molecular weight determination\n\nThe molecular weight---either $M_n$ or $M_w$---is one of the most\nimportant parameters which characterizes a polymer sample. It can be\ndetermined in a number of ways, but rarely with complete accuracy. For\nexample, the viscosity of a polymer solution or melt increases with\nincreasing $M$ in a predictable way using **viscometry**. The most\ncommon methods however use the the size of the polymers in solution as a\nsubstitute for the molecular weight.\n\n#### Size-exclusion chromatography\n\nA versatile method for determining the molecular weight ($M_n$, $M_w$,\nand thus ) is based on the retention time of polymers in solution as it\npasses through a gel consisting of porous beads. In this method, the\nlarger polymer blobs go around the beads and **elute**[^5.6.7] first. The\nsmaller polymer blobs get temporarily stuck inside the pores within the\nbeads and come out later. This method is often referred to in polymer\nengineering as **gel-permeation chromatography (GPC)**, but is perhaps\nbetter described using a term for the same technique but which is used\nin biochemistry, **size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)**.\n\n### 5.6.7. Other characterization tools There are other\ncharacterization tools used in the determination of the molecular weight\nof polymers, including **dynamic light scattering** (DLS), which can be\nused to measure the sizes of particles based on the rate at which they\nget closer together and farther apart due to random Brownian motion.\nAnother technique is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry (**MALDI-TOF-MS**). In MALDI-TOF-MS,\nthe polymer is coated on a thin polymeric matrix which is blasted with\ncharged particles. The matrix and the polymer of interest are fragmented\nby the beam and accelerated toward a detector. The amount of time that\nit takes to reach the detector is based on the ratio of mass to charge.\nFrom these data, it is usually possible to determine the mass of the\nlargest fragment, which often corresponds to that of the entire polymer\nchain. Finally, the sizes of polymer blobs can be obtained by\nmeasurements of **osmotic pressure**. In this method, the pressure\ngenerated through a semi-permeable membrane can be related to the size\nand molecular weight of the polymer blobs.\n\n[^5.6.1]: The dispersity used to be called the *polydispersity*, but then\n    IUPAC decided this word was redundant.\n\n[^5.6.2]: A retronym meaning \"not a copolymer.\"\n\n[^5.6.3]: A quick Google search for \"block copolymer nanostructure\" will\n    show some of the intricate nanoscale patters that can be achieved.\n\n[^5.6.4]: Rubber that can be melted and reformed\n\n[^5.6.5]: I'm not sure who said this first, but I attribute it to Lieutenant\n    Sulu on *Star Trek*: If you have a penny and double it every day for\n    a month, you'll be poor for most of that month, but at the end of\n    the month you'll be a millionaire.\n\n[^5.6.6]: Technically the root-mean squared distance.\n\n[^5.6.7]: come out\n",

To get $M_n$, we add up\nthe weight of the entire sample of polymer and divides by the number of\nchains, as in equation (5.1):\n\n(Equation 5.1) $$M_n=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i}{\\Sigma N_i}$$\n\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of polymers with degree of polymerization $i$\nand $M_i$ is the mass of the chain with degree of polymerization $i$.\nThis method of calculating the average molecular weight can be\nmisleading, however. This method of calculating the molecular weight\ntends to over-value the contributions of low-molecular-weight chains in\nthe sample, even though most of the actual mass of the sample is made of\nhigher molecular weight stuff. For example, if a sample consisted of two\npolymer chains, one with a mass of 20 and one with a mass of 2,000,000,\nthen $M_n$ would be about 1,000,000, but the properties would be\ndominated by the chain which occupied the largest fraction of the\nsample, by mass. In fact, it would behave almost identically to a sample\nwith $M_n$ of 2,000,000. To account for this misleading result of using\nonly the $M_n$ to characterize the sample, we use $M_w$. This value\ngives you a number that reflects the weights of the polymer chains that\nrepresent the largest fraction of the sample, as in equation (5.2)\n\n(Equation 5.2)\n$$M_w=\\frac{\\Sigma w_i M_i}{\\Sigma w_i}=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i^2}{\\Sigma N_i M_i}$$\n\nwhere $w_i$ is the weight of the entire sample with degree of\npolymerization $i$, or $N_iM_i$. Molecular weight (any type) has the\nunits of g mol$^{-1}$ or Dalton, Da.\n\n#### Dispersity\n\nThe dispersity is defined as =$\\frac{M_w}{M_n}$, which is always\n$\\geq$ 1. The larger the number , the larger the distribution of\nmolecular weights. In general, as we will find in the next chapter,\nlarger s mean less internal order, lower **glass transition\ntemperatures**, and greater mechanical compliance.\n\n### 5.6.5. Polymers as nanomaterials\n\nPolymers are one of the most fundamental types of nanostructured\nmaterials: a single polymer chain in solution is, fundamentally, a\nnanoparticle. The characteristic size of a polymer chain in solution is\ngiven by its **radius of gyration**, $R_g$, which can be thought of as\nthe average distance[^5.6.6] of the monomer residues from the center of mass\nof the polymer blob, which approximates a sphere. The $R_g$ can\neffectively be treated as a measure of the size of the polymer blob in\nsolution.\n\nThe volume of a polymer blob can be thought of in two different ways.\nThe first way is to calculate the volume taken up by the polymer blob,\nincluding the solvent molecules, or $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_g^3$. The second\nway is to calculate the volume of the polymer strand, which can be\nvisualized as a long cylinder, like a piece of spaghetti. This volume is\napproximately 10% of the volume of the polymer blob, which means that\nthe total volume occupied by the blob is actually 90% solvent!\n\nThe size of the blob depends on the solvent. In a \"good\" solvent, which\nhas favorable interactions with the monomer residues of the polymer, the\nblob expands. In a \"bad\" solvent, the monomer residues prefer\ninteracting with themselves (and/or the solvent molecules prefer\ninteracting with themselves instead of the polymer), and the blob\ncontracts. In the middle, we have a **theta solvent**, which is a\nsolvent that is good enough to \"cancel out\" the van der Waals forces\nbetween the monomer residues, and the size of the polymer blob is\nsomewhere in between what it would be in a good solvent on one side and\na bad solvent on the other. You can think of a theta solvent as being\n\"invisible\" to the polymer blob. That is, the polymer chain behaves as\nif there were no van der Waals forces between the residues. Because the\nentropy of a polymer in solution---and thus its solubility---depends on\ntemperature, any solvent can be turned into a theta solvent at a\nspecific temperature, known as the **theta temperature**.\n\n### 5.6.6. Molecular weight determination\n\nThe molecular weight---either $M_n$ or $M_w$---is one of the most\nimportant parameters which characterizes a polymer sample. It can be\ndetermined in a number of ways, but rarely with complete accuracy. For\nexample, the viscosity of a polymer solution or melt increases with\nincreasing $M$ in a predictable way using **viscometry**. The most\ncommon methods however use the the size of the polymers in solution as a\nsubstitute for the molecular weight.\n\n#### Size-exclusion chromatography\n\nA versatile method for determining the molecular weight ($M_n$, $M_w$,\nand thus ) is based on the retention time of polymers in solution as it\npasses through a gel consisting of porous beads. In this method, the\nlarger polymer blobs go around the beads and **elute**[^5.6.7] first. The\nsmaller polymer blobs get temporarily stuck inside the pores within the\nbeads and come out later. This method is often referred to in polymer\nengineering as **gel-permeation chromatography (GPC)**, but is perhaps\nbetter described using a term for the same technique but which is used\nin biochemistry, **size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)**.\n\n### 5.6.7. Other characterization tools There are other\ncharacterization tools used in the determination of the molecular weight\nof polymers, including **dynamic light scattering** (DLS), which can be\nused to measure the sizes of particles based on the rate at which they\nget closer together and farther apart due to random Brownian motion.\nAnother technique is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry (**MALDI-TOF-MS**). In MALDI-TOF-MS,\nthe polymer is coated on a thin polymeric matrix which is blasted with\ncharged particles. The matrix and the polymer of interest are fragmented\nby the beam and accelerated toward a detector. The amount of time that\nit takes to reach the detector is based on the ratio of mass to charge.\nFrom these data, it is usually possible to determine the mass of the\nlargest fragment, which often corresponds to that of the entire polymer\nchain. Finally, the sizes of polymer blobs can be obtained by\nmeasurements of **osmotic pressure**. In this method, the pressure\ngenerated through a semi-permeable membrane can be related to the size\nand molecular weight of the polymer blobs.\n\n[^5.6.1]: The dispersity used to be called the *polydispersity*, but then\n    IUPAC decided this word was redundant.\n\n[^5.6.2]: A retronym meaning \"not a copolymer.\"\n\n[^5.6.3]: A quick Google search for \"block copolymer nanostructure\" will\n    show some of the intricate nanoscale patters that can be achieved.\n\n[^5.6.4]: Rubber that can be melted and reformed\n\n[^5.6.5]: I'm not sure who said this first, but I attribute it to Lieutenant\n    Sulu on *Star Trek*: If you have a penny and double it every day for\n    a month, you'll be poor for most of that month, but at the end of\n    the month you'll be a millionaire.\n\n[^5.6.6]: Technically the root-mean squared distance.\n\n[^5.6.7]: come out\n",

      "content": "#### Section 5: Polymers as molecules and nanostructures\nPolymeric materials are ubiquitous in nanoengineering applications. For\nexample, as **photoresists** (the light-sensitive chemicals used in\nmicroelectronics fabrication), as **drug-delivery nanoparticles**, as\n**biomaterials** for regenerative medicine, as the charge-transport or\nencapsulation layers in **thin-film photovoltaic cells**, and as\ncomponents of **nanocomposite aerospace materials**. Compared to\ninorganic solids, polymers offer greater mechanical strength and\ntoughness, light weight, and synthetic tunability for biocompatibility,\nlight emission and absorption, chemical sensitivity, mechanical\ncompliance, and many other useful attributes.\n\nThere are two ways in which we can consider the properties of polymers.\nThe first way---discussed in this chapter---treats polymers as chemical\nobjects. That is, molecules or nanomaterials having properties like\ndipole moment, molecular weight, and polarizability. The second\nway---discussed in the next chapter---treats polymers as solid materials\nhaving bulk properties. That is, density, modulus, and conductivity.\n\n### 5.5.1. Structure of polymers\n\nExemplars of polymer synthesis are shown in Figure (5.4). Polymers are\nnamed after the monomer, whether or not something that looks like the\nmonomer is actually incorporated into the backbone of the polymer. For\nexample, in the synthesis of polyethylene, the monomer ethylene contains\na double bond, whereas the bonds in polyethylene are all single bonds.\nThe double bond in the monomer is needed because the electrons involved\nin the $\\pi$ bond of the double bond are needed to form the new single\nbond between monomers. Technically, the monomers are called **monomer\nresidues** once incorporated into the backbone of a polymer, though this\nword is used mostly by biologists in reference to **amino acid\nresidues** that make up the linear structure of proteins.\n\n#### Polyolefins\n\nThe polymers polyethylene and poly(methylmethacrylate) shown in Figure\n(5.4) are called **polyolefins**, which means that they are derived from\nthe rearrangement of the $\\pi$ bonds of double bonded monomers to form\nthe polymer.[^5.5.1] A characteristic of such polymers is that the backbone\n*contains nothing but carbon atoms!* Most polymers that look like this\nare made industrially by a **radical, cationic**, or **anionic\nmechanism**, we will not go through these mechanisms in detail. Suffice\nit to say, radical mechanisms operate by splitting the $\\pi$ bond of the\nmonomer into two individual electrons, which link up to form the new\nbonds. Cationic polymerizations are mediated by the movement of a\npositive charge, and anionic polymerizations are mediated by the\nmovement of a negative charge.\n\n#### Polycondensation reactions\n\nThere are other polymers, however, which contain *heteroatoms* in the\nbackbone, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon. Some of the\nmost well known examples of these heteroatom-containing polymers are\nderived from carbonyl compounds, and form polymer with the carbonyls\nintact. Examples of nitrogen-containing polymers that follow this\npattern are nylon and Kevlar (Figure (5.6), below).\n\n(Figure 5.6) \n>>>image(polyamide.png.0)\n\nExamples of oxygen-containing polymers that follow this pattern are\npolycarbonate (used in eyeglasses) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)\n(PET, a.k.a. polyester, used in clothing and soda bottles, Figure\n(5.7)).\n\n(Figure 5.7) \n>>>image(PET.png.0)\n\nThe chemical process by which such materials are synthesized is known as\n**polycondensation**, Figure (5.8). A polycondensation reaction follows\nthe general formula, shown below. The key is that a small molecule\n(often either water or hydrochloric acid) is ejected for every monomer\nthat joins the chain. The reaction is termed a *condensation* because\nthe molecular weight of the polymer chain is less than the weight of all\nthe monomers by the amount of this ejected monomer.\n\n(Figure 5.8) \n>>>image(polycondensation.png.0)\n\n[^5.5.1]: **Olefin** was the old-timey name for alkene, or carbon-carbon\n    double bond. One might have said so in the first place!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 4: Chemical reactivity\nIn this course, we have taken a relaxed definition of the word \"bond\"\nsuch that it includes van der Waals bonds and other electrostatic\ninteractions. In this section, we will briefly mention the types of\nbonds that form in traditional chemical systems. That is, those that\ninvolve the movement or formal sharing or transfer of electrons.\n\n### 5.4.1. Electrostatic attraction and ionic bonding The most basic\ntype of bond is the one described in subsection (2.1.1). This is a\nclassic ionic bond between oppositely charged species that obeys\nCoulomb's law of electrostatic attraction. There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Basic nomenclature\nJust like writing in a markup language like LaTeX or HTML, one can\ndescribe any molecule using a linear sequence of words, numbers, and\nbrackets. We will call this language *Organic*. It operates by the\nnomenclature established by the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC). However, by describing chemical structures only in\nwords, the IUPAC name gets really long even for simple compounds. In\nfact, most chemists don't use IUPAC names for any but the most basic\nstructures (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, and butane). After all, it\nis almost always easier to just draw the structure. Moreover, most\ncomplicated structures have common names (like aspirin, ibuprofen, and\nPaxlovid). Thankfully, we don't need to know very many types of\nstructures in this course. Let's start with the linear hydrocarbons.\n\n### 5.2.1. Hydrocarbons: Counting to twelve in *Organic* Just like any\nother language, Organic has words corresponding to numbers of carbon\natoms. So, the words for the hydrocarbons of the general formula C\n$_{{n}}$ H $_{2{n}+2}$ as follows for $n$:\n\n1.  methane\n\n2.  ethane\n\n3.  propane\n\n4.  butane\n\n5.  pentane\n\n6.  hexane\n\n7.  heptane\n\n8.  octane\n\n9.  nonane\n\n10. decane\n\n11. undecane\n\n12. dodecane\n\nIf you need to count beyond 12, there is a pattern: tridecane,\ntetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane,\nnonadecane, and finally isocane for $n=20$.\n\nWhen converting the name of molecule to its structure, we usually leave\nout the carbon and hydrogen atoms. The reason is because they appear so\nregularly it would be tedious if we had to keep writing them. Instead,\nwe just draw the bonds---the atoms are implied. A carbon atom always has\nfour bonds. If the bonding partners are not shown, we assume that the\nremaining bonds are to hydrogen. Every vertex and terminus of the\nstructure signify a carbon atom. So, pentane, with the empirical formula\nC $_{5}$ H $_{12}$ , has the structure shown in Figure (5.1):\n\n(Figure 5.1) \n>>>image(pentane.png.0)\n\nVerify that you could draw the structures of any of the hydrocarbons\nwith $n=1-20$.\n",

For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Basic nomenclature\nJust like writing in a markup language like LaTeX or HTML, one can\ndescribe any molecule using a linear sequence of words, numbers, and\nbrackets. We will call this language *Organic*. It operates by the\nnomenclature established by the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC). However, by describing chemical structures only in\nwords, the IUPAC name gets really long even for simple compounds. In\nfact, most chemists don't use IUPAC names for any but the most basic\nstructures (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, and butane). After all, it\nis almost always easier to just draw the structure. Moreover, most\ncomplicated structures have common names (like aspirin, ibuprofen, and\nPaxlovid). Thankfully, we don't need to know very many types of\nstructures in this course. Let's start with the linear hydrocarbons.\n\n### 5.2.1. Hydrocarbons: Counting to twelve in *Organic* Just like any\nother language, Organic has words corresponding to numbers of carbon\natoms. So, the words for the hydrocarbons of the general formula C\n$_{{n}}$ H $_{2{n}+2}$ as follows for $n$:\n\n1.  methane\n\n2.  ethane\n\n3.  propane\n\n4.  butane\n\n5.  pentane\n\n6.  hexane\n\n7.  heptane\n\n8.  octane\n\n9.  nonane\n\n10. decane\n\n11. undecane\n\n12. dodecane\n\nIf you need to count beyond 12, there is a pattern: tridecane,\ntetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane,\nnonadecane, and finally isocane for $n=20$.\n\nWhen converting the name of molecule to its structure, we usually leave\nout the carbon and hydrogen atoms. The reason is because they appear so\nregularly it would be tedious if we had to keep writing them. Instead,\nwe just draw the bonds---the atoms are implied. A carbon atom always has\nfour bonds. If the bonding partners are not shown, we assume that the\nremaining bonds are to hydrogen. Every vertex and terminus of the\nstructure signify a carbon atom. So, pentane, with the empirical formula\nC $_{5}$ H $_{12}$ , has the structure shown in Figure (5.1):\n\n(Figure 5.1) \n>>>image(pentane.png.0)\n\nVerify that you could draw the structures of any of the hydrocarbons\nwith $n=1-20$.\n",

For\nexample, as **photoresists** (the light-sensitive chemicals used in\nmicroelectronics fabrication), as **drug-delivery nanoparticles**, as\n**biomaterials** for regenerative medicine, as the charge-transport or\nencapsulation layers in **thin-film photovoltaic cells**, and as\ncomponents of **nanocomposite aerospace materials**. Compared to\ninorganic solids, polymers offer greater mechanical strength and\ntoughness, light weight, and synthetic tunability for biocompatibility,\nlight emission and absorption, chemical sensitivity, mechanical\ncompliance, and many other useful attributes.\n\nThere are two ways in which we can consider the properties of polymers.\nThe first way---discussed in this chapter---treats polymers as chemical\nobjects. That is, molecules or nanomaterials having properties like\ndipole moment, molecular weight, and polarizability. The second\nway---discussed in the next chapter---treats polymers as solid materials\nhaving bulk properties. That is, density, modulus, and conductivity.\n\n### 5.5.1. Structure of polymers\n\nExemplars of polymer synthesis are shown in Figure (5.4). Polymers are\nnamed after the monomer, whether or not something that looks like the\nmonomer is actually incorporated into the backbone of the polymer. For\nexample, in the synthesis of polyethylene, the monomer ethylene contains\na double bond, whereas the bonds in polyethylene are all single bonds.\nThe double bond in the monomer is needed because the electrons involved\nin the $\\pi$ bond of the double bond are needed to form the new single\nbond between monomers. Technically, the monomers are called **monomer\nresidues** once incorporated into the backbone of a polymer, though this\nword is used mostly by biologists in reference to **amino acid\nresidues** that make up the linear structure of proteins.\n\n#### Polyolefins\n\nThe polymers polyethylene and poly(methylmethacrylate) shown in Figure\n(5.4) are called **polyolefins**, which means that they are derived from\nthe rearrangement of the $\\pi$ bonds of double bonded monomers to form\nthe polymer.[^5.5.1] A characteristic of such polymers is that the backbone\n*contains nothing but carbon atoms!* Most polymers that look like this\nare made industrially by a **radical, cationic**, or **anionic\nmechanism**, we will not go through these mechanisms in detail. Suffice\nit to say, radical mechanisms operate by splitting the $\\pi$ bond of the\nmonomer into two individual electrons, which link up to form the new\nbonds. Cationic polymerizations are mediated by the movement of a\npositive charge, and anionic polymerizations are mediated by the\nmovement of a negative charge.\n\n#### Polycondensation reactions\n\nThere are other polymers, however, which contain *heteroatoms* in the\nbackbone, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon. Some of the\nmost well known examples of these heteroatom-containing polymers are\nderived from carbonyl compounds, and form polymer with the carbonyls\nintact. Examples of nitrogen-containing polymers that follow this\npattern are nylon and Kevlar (Figure (5.6), below).\n\n(Figure 5.6) \n>>>image(polyamide.png.0)\n\nExamples of oxygen-containing polymers that follow this pattern are\npolycarbonate (used in eyeglasses) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)\n(PET, a.k.a. polyester, used in clothing and soda bottles, Figure\n(5.7)).\n\n(Figure 5.7) \n>>>image(PET.png.0)\n\nThe chemical process by which such materials are synthesized is known as\n**polycondensation**, Figure (5.8). A polycondensation reaction follows\nthe general formula, shown below. The key is that a small molecule\n(often either water or hydrochloric acid) is ejected for every monomer\nthat joins the chain. The reaction is termed a *condensation* because\nthe molecular weight of the polymer chain is less than the weight of all\nthe monomers by the amount of this ejected monomer.\n\n(Figure 5.8) \n>>>image(polycondensation.png.0)\n\n[^5.5.1]: **Olefin** was the old-timey name for alkene, or carbon-carbon\n    double bond.

      "content": "#### Section 6: Polymerization kinetics: Chain-growth and step-growth\nA polymer chain can grow one of two ways, by a **chain-growth** process\n(a.k.a. **addition**) or by a **step-growth** process (a.k.a.\n**condensation**). In chain-growth processes, one monomer adds one at a\ntime to the growing chain end: monomers react only with growing chain\nends. Monomers do not react with each other except upon **initiation**,\nand polymer chains do not react with each other, except upon\n**termination**. Chain-growth processes can be further subdivided into\n**uncontrolled** or **controlled** reaction types. In step-growth\nprocesses, every monomer and polymer is reactive toward every other\nmonomer and polymer in the mixture. The growth process of a polymer\ndetermines its distribution of molecular weight and has a profound\ninfluence on the applications to which it is suited.\n\n### 5.6.1. Chain-growth: Uncontrolled\n\nOf the 370 million metric tons (\"tonnes\") of polymers produced annually\naround the globe, the vast majority are polyolefins, and around half of\nthese are synthesized by (uncontrolled) free-radical polymerization.\nThese materials are dominated by polyethylene (plastic bags and milk\njugs), polypropylene (carpet), poly(vinyl chloride) (pipes, shower\ncurtains, LP records), and polystyrene (styrofoam, plastic petri\ndishes). We will not go into the mechanism here, but the reaction\nproceeds by what I think of as the *popcorn mechanism*. Picture all the\nmonomers in a big steel reactor. A radical initiator is sprinkled in.\nEach initiator molecule, at some random time, causes a chain reaction.\nOne monomer reacts with the next to form a dimer, the dimer reacts with\nanother monomer to form a trimer, the trimer reacts with another monomer\nto form a tetramer. This process repeats hundreds or thousands of times\nuntil it stops abruptly by colliding with another molecule. Some\npolymers stop at 100 monomers, some stop at 500 or 10,000. The number of\nmonomer residues in a polymer chain is called the **degree of\npolymerization**, $i$, and in free radical polymerizations it is a\nstatistical assortment of sort-of random chain lengths. This randomness\nleads to a large distribution of degrees of polymerization or\n**dispersity**.[^5.6.1]\n\nBecause of the randomness with which each polymer chain initiates and\nspeed with which it grows once commenced, the reaction mixture consists\nof unreacted monomers, along with fully formed polymer chains, with very\nfew partly formed polymers. Thus, the average molecular weight, $M_{n}$,\nof polymer chains---excluding unreacted monomers---is reached quickly. I\ncall uncontrolled chain growth the *popcorn mechanism* because at any\nlocation, you have either a piece of popcorn---a polymer chain---or an\nunpopped kernel---a monomer. The \"pops\" occur in random locations in the\nreaction mixture. A conceptual drawing showing the wide range in\ndistribution of molecular weights is shown in the following, Figure\n(5.9).\n\n(Figure 5.9) \n>>>image(uncontrolled.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.2. Chain-growth: Controlled or \"living\"\n\nA controlled chain-growth process is one in which the polymerization is\nslowed to an extent that all polymer chains initiate at around the same\ntime, and then monomers add a few at a time to each growing polymer\nchain. Often, this type of process is called **living** (Figure (5.10)),\nmeaning that once one type of monomer is consumed, a second type of\nmonomer can be added into the reaction mixture, which then adds to the\ngrowing polymer chains.\n\n(Figure 5.10) \n>>>image(living.png.0)\n\n#### Block copolymers\n\nThus, it is possible to make polymers with *blocks* of each type of\nmonomer residue. Such a structure is called a **block copolymer**.\nPolymers with the structure AAAABBBBB etc. are called **diblock**\ncopolymers, and those of the type AAAABBBBCCCC are called **triblock**\ncopolymers. While most **homopolymers**[^5.6.2] phase separate when mixed\n(like oil and water), block copolymers do not. In fact, while the \"A\"\nblocks and the \"B\" blocks of block copolymers might \"prefer\" to be\nseparated, they are covalently linked and thus prevented from doing so.\nInstead, they form nanostructures of \"A domains\" inside of a continuous\nphase of B, or vice-versa.[^5.6.3] Typically, block copolymers give the\n\"best of both worlds\" in properties held by either block alone. In\ncontrast, physical blends of the two polymers (without covalent\nattachment) tends to give an averaging of the properties, which leads to\nmaterials having the \"worst of both worlds\" (e.g., of, say, strength and\nchemical resistance). Block copolymers are useful for many things, such\nas porous films for separation membranes, low-dielectric films for\ngraphics processors, and as **thermoplastic elastomers**[^5.6.4] for 3D\nprinting, e.g., poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), or SBS rubber.\n\n### 5.6.3. Step-growth polymerization\n\nIn contrast to chain-growth polymerization, in which monomers add to\ngrowing chains one at a time, in a step-growth process, anything goes.\nThat is, a monomer has two reactive ends and can react with any monomer\nor any growing chain in the soup. So, a dimer can add to a dimer to make\na tetramer, two tetramers can add to form an octomer, and basically\nanything in the mix an add to anything else at any time. As a result of\nthis process, it takes a long time (percentage of reacted functional\ngroups) for polymers to form with large molecular weights. That is, it's\nnot until the last few reactions that 50-mers form 100-mers, 100-mers\nform 200-mers, and so on.[^5.6.5] For most of the reaction, you have mostly\nshort oligomers. At the end, you have long polymers. The rough plot of\n$M_{n}$ vs. % reacted functional groups for step-growth polymerization\nprocesses looks like the plot shown in Figure (5.11).\n\n(Figure 5.11) \n>>>image(step-growth.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.4. A word about molecular weight\n\nThe molecular weight of a polymer can be described in various ways, the\ntwo most popular of which are the **number-average molecular weight**,\n$M_{n}$, and the **weight-average molecular weight**, $M_{w}$. The\nformer, $M_{n}$, is the conventional average. To get $M_n$, we add up\nthe weight of the entire sample of polymer and divides by the number of\nchains, as in equation (5.1):\n\n(Equation 5.1) $$M_n=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i}{\\Sigma N_i}$$\n\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of polymers with degree of polymerization $i$\nand $M_i$ is the mass of the chain with degree of polymerization $i$.\nThis method of calculating the average molecular weight can be\nmisleading, however. This method of calculating the molecular weight\ntends to over-value the contributions of low-molecular-weight chains in\nthe sample, even though most of the actual mass of the sample is made of\nhigher molecular weight stuff. For example, if a sample consisted of two\npolymer chains, one with a mass of 20 and one with a mass of 2,000,000,\nthen $M_n$ would be about 1,000,000, but the properties would be\ndominated by the chain which occupied the largest fraction of the\nsample, by mass. In fact, it would behave almost identically to a sample\nwith $M_n$ of 2,000,000. To account for this misleading result of using\nonly the $M_n$ to characterize the sample, we use $M_w$. This value\ngives you a number that reflects the weights of the polymer chains that\nrepresent the largest fraction of the sample, as in equation (5.2)\n\n(Equation 5.2)\n$$M_w=\\frac{\\Sigma w_i M_i}{\\Sigma w_i}=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i^2}{\\Sigma N_i M_i}$$\n\nwhere $w_i$ is the weight of the entire sample with degree of\npolymerization $i$, or $N_iM_i$. Molecular weight (any type) has the\nunits of g mol$^{-1}$ or Dalton, Da.\n\n#### Dispersity\n\nThe dispersity is defined as =$\\frac{M_w}{M_n}$, which is always\n$\\geq$ 1. The larger the number , the larger the distribution of\nmolecular weights. In general, as we will find in the next chapter,\nlarger s mean less internal order, lower **glass transition\ntemperatures**, and greater mechanical compliance.\n\n### 5.6.5. Polymers as nanomaterials\n\nPolymers are one of the most fundamental types of nanostructured\nmaterials: a single polymer chain in solution is, fundamentally, a\nnanoparticle. The characteristic size of a polymer chain in solution is\ngiven by its **radius of gyration**, $R_g$, which can be thought of as\nthe average distance[^5.6.6] of the monomer residues from the center of mass\nof the polymer blob, which approximates a sphere. The $R_g$ can\neffectively be treated as a measure of the size of the polymer blob in\nsolution.\n\nThe volume of a polymer blob can be thought of in two different ways.\nThe first way is to calculate the volume taken up by the polymer blob,\nincluding the solvent molecules, or $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_g^3$. The second\nway is to calculate the volume of the polymer strand, which can be\nvisualized as a long cylinder, like a piece of spaghetti. This volume is\napproximately 10% of the volume of the polymer blob, which means that\nthe total volume occupied by the blob is actually 90% solvent!\n\nThe size of the blob depends on the solvent. In a \"good\" solvent, which\nhas favorable interactions with the monomer residues of the polymer, the\nblob expands. In a \"bad\" solvent, the monomer residues prefer\ninteracting with themselves (and/or the solvent molecules prefer\ninteracting with themselves instead of the polymer), and the blob\ncontracts. In the middle, we have a **theta solvent**, which is a\nsolvent that is good enough to \"cancel out\" the van der Waals forces\nbetween the monomer residues, and the size of the polymer blob is\nsomewhere in between what it would be in a good solvent on one side and\na bad solvent on the other. You can think of a theta solvent as being\n\"invisible\" to the polymer blob. That is, the polymer chain behaves as\nif there were no van der Waals forces between the residues. Because the\nentropy of a polymer in solution---and thus its solubility---depends on\ntemperature, any solvent can be turned into a theta solvent at a\nspecific temperature, known as the **theta temperature**.\n\n### 5.6.6. Molecular weight determination\n\nThe molecular weight---either $M_n$ or $M_w$---is one of the most\nimportant parameters which characterizes a polymer sample. It can be\ndetermined in a number of ways, but rarely with complete accuracy. For\nexample, the viscosity of a polymer solution or melt increases with\nincreasing $M$ in a predictable way using **viscometry**. The most\ncommon methods however use the the size of the polymers in solution as a\nsubstitute for the molecular weight.\n\n#### Size-exclusion chromatography\n\nA versatile method for determining the molecular weight ($M_n$, $M_w$,\nand thus ) is based on the retention time of polymers in solution as it\npasses through a gel consisting of porous beads. In this method, the\nlarger polymer blobs go around the beads and **elute**[^5.6.7] first. The\nsmaller polymer blobs get temporarily stuck inside the pores within the\nbeads and come out later. This method is often referred to in polymer\nengineering as **gel-permeation chromatography (GPC)**, but is perhaps\nbetter described using a term for the same technique but which is used\nin biochemistry, **size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)**.\n\n### 5.6.7. Other characterization tools There are other\ncharacterization tools used in the determination of the molecular weight\nof polymers, including **dynamic light scattering** (DLS), which can be\nused to measure the sizes of particles based on the rate at which they\nget closer together and farther apart due to random Brownian motion.\nAnother technique is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry (**MALDI-TOF-MS**). In MALDI-TOF-MS,\nthe polymer is coated on a thin polymeric matrix which is blasted with\ncharged particles. The matrix and the polymer of interest are fragmented\nby the beam and accelerated toward a detector. The amount of time that\nit takes to reach the detector is based on the ratio of mass to charge.\nFrom these data, it is usually possible to determine the mass of the\nlargest fragment, which often corresponds to that of the entire polymer\nchain. Finally, the sizes of polymer blobs can be obtained by\nmeasurements of **osmotic pressure**. In this method, the pressure\ngenerated through a semi-permeable membrane can be related to the size\nand molecular weight of the polymer blobs.\n\n[^5.6.1]: The dispersity used to be called the *polydispersity*, but then\n    IUPAC decided this word was redundant.\n\n[^5.6.2]: A retronym meaning \"not a copolymer.\"\n\n[^5.6.3]: A quick Google search for \"block copolymer nanostructure\" will\n    show some of the intricate nanoscale patters that can be achieved.\n\n[^5.6.4]: Rubber that can be melted and reformed\n\n[^5.6.5]: I'm not sure who said this first, but I attribute it to Lieutenant\n    Sulu on *Star Trek*: If you have a penny and double it every day for\n    a month, you'll be poor for most of that month, but at the end of\n    the month you'll be a millionaire.\n\n[^5.6.6]: Technically the root-mean squared distance.\n\n[^5.6.7]: come out\n",

Compared to\ninorganic solids, polymers offer greater mechanical strength and\ntoughness, light weight, and synthetic tunability for biocompatibility,\nlight emission and absorption, chemical sensitivity, mechanical\ncompliance, and many other useful attributes.\n\nThere are two ways in which we can consider the properties of polymers.\nThe first way---discussed in this chapter---treats polymers as chemical\nobjects. That is, molecules or nanomaterials having properties like\ndipole moment, molecular weight, and polarizability. The second\nway---discussed in the next chapter---treats polymers as solid materials\nhaving bulk properties. That is, density, modulus, and conductivity.\n\n### 5.5.1. Structure of polymers\n\nExemplars of polymer synthesis are shown in Figure (5.4).

In this section, we will briefly mention the types of\nbonds that form in traditional chemical systems. That is, those that\ninvolve the movement or formal sharing or transfer of electrons.\n\n### 5.4.1. Electrostatic attraction and ionic bonding The most basic\ntype of bond is the one described in subsection (2.1.1). This is a\nclassic ionic bond between oppositely charged species that obeys\nCoulomb's law of electrostatic attraction. There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",

There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds.

      "content": "#### Section 5: Polymers as molecules and nanostructures\nPolymeric materials are ubiquitous in nanoengineering applications. For\nexample, as **photoresists** (the light-sensitive chemicals used in\nmicroelectronics fabrication), as **drug-delivery nanoparticles**, as\n**biomaterials** for regenerative medicine, as the charge-transport or\nencapsulation layers in **thin-film photovoltaic cells**, and as\ncomponents of **nanocomposite aerospace materials**. Compared to\ninorganic solids, polymers offer greater mechanical strength and\ntoughness, light weight, and synthetic tunability for biocompatibility,\nlight emission and absorption, chemical sensitivity, mechanical\ncompliance, and many other useful attributes.\n\nThere are two ways in which we can consider the properties of polymers.\nThe first way---discussed in this chapter---treats polymers as chemical\nobjects. That is, molecules or nanomaterials having properties like\ndipole moment, molecular weight, and polarizability. The second\nway---discussed in the next chapter---treats polymers as solid materials\nhaving bulk properties. That is, density, modulus, and conductivity.\n\n### 5.5.1. Structure of polymers\n\nExemplars of polymer synthesis are shown in Figure (5.4). Polymers are\nnamed after the monomer, whether or not something that looks like the\nmonomer is actually incorporated into the backbone of the polymer. For\nexample, in the synthesis of polyethylene, the monomer ethylene contains\na double bond, whereas the bonds in polyethylene are all single bonds.\nThe double bond in the monomer is needed because the electrons involved\nin the $\\pi$ bond of the double bond are needed to form the new single\nbond between monomers. Technically, the monomers are called **monomer\nresidues** once incorporated into the backbone of a polymer, though this\nword is used mostly by biologists in reference to **amino acid\nresidues** that make up the linear structure of proteins.\n\n#### Polyolefins\n\nThe polymers polyethylene and poly(methylmethacrylate) shown in Figure\n(5.4) are called **polyolefins**, which means that they are derived from\nthe rearrangement of the $\\pi$ bonds of double bonded monomers to form\nthe polymer.[^5.5.1] A characteristic of such polymers is that the backbone\n*contains nothing but carbon atoms!* Most polymers that look like this\nare made industrially by a **radical, cationic**, or **anionic\nmechanism**, we will not go through these mechanisms in detail. Suffice\nit to say, radical mechanisms operate by splitting the $\\pi$ bond of the\nmonomer into two individual electrons, which link up to form the new\nbonds. Cationic polymerizations are mediated by the movement of a\npositive charge, and anionic polymerizations are mediated by the\nmovement of a negative charge.\n\n#### Polycondensation reactions\n\nThere are other polymers, however, which contain *heteroatoms* in the\nbackbone, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon. Some of the\nmost well known examples of these heteroatom-containing polymers are\nderived from carbonyl compounds, and form polymer with the carbonyls\nintact. Examples of nitrogen-containing polymers that follow this\npattern are nylon and Kevlar (Figure (5.6), below).\n\n(Figure 5.6) \n>>>image(polyamide.png.0)\n\nExamples of oxygen-containing polymers that follow this pattern are\npolycarbonate (used in eyeglasses) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)\n(PET, a.k.a. polyester, used in clothing and soda bottles, Figure\n(5.7)).\n\n(Figure 5.7) \n>>>image(PET.png.0)\n\nThe chemical process by which such materials are synthesized is known as\n**polycondensation**, Figure (5.8). A polycondensation reaction follows\nthe general formula, shown below. The key is that a small molecule\n(often either water or hydrochloric acid) is ejected for every monomer\nthat joins the chain. The reaction is termed a *condensation* because\nthe molecular weight of the polymer chain is less than the weight of all\nthe monomers by the amount of this ejected monomer.\n\n(Figure 5.8) \n>>>image(polycondensation.png.0)\n\n[^5.5.1]: **Olefin** was the old-timey name for alkene, or carbon-carbon\n    double bond. One might have said so in the first place!\n",

One type of\norganic nanostructure is a **polymer**. Polymers are long chains of\natoms, usually made of carbon and a few other elements. This is the\nfirst chapter in a series of three on polymers. Chapter 5 treats\npolymers as examples of organic nanostructures (as in vaccine delivery\nparticles), Chapter 6 treats them as the components of solid objects (as\nin a piece of plexiglass), and Chapter 7 covers some examples of\nelectronic polymers. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/v_5SYuuiyK4)\n\nOrganic structures play a central role in nanoengineering. They comprise\nall polymers (including all photoresists used in nanofabrication),\nliquid crystals, molecular dyes, and many of the additives used during\nthe growth of nanocrystals and quantum dots. Moreover, polymers are\nfound widely in biology and comprise most biological macromolecules:\npolypeptides, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. Almost every drug\nmolecule is an organic structure. Lucky for us, it is not necessary to\ntake an entire year of organic chemistry to learn what you need to know\nto be an effective nanoengineer. In fact, it's best not to even think of\nthis material as \"organic chemistry.\" Rather, you can think of it as\n*molecular structure and bonding*.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Basic nomenclature\nJust like writing in a markup language like LaTeX or HTML, one can\ndescribe any molecule using a linear sequence of words, numbers, and\nbrackets. We will call this language *Organic*. It operates by the\nnomenclature established by the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC). However, by describing chemical structures only in\nwords, the IUPAC name gets really long even for simple compounds. In\nfact, most chemists don't use IUPAC names for any but the most basic\nstructures (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, and butane). After all, it\nis almost always easier to just draw the structure. Moreover, most\ncomplicated structures have common names (like aspirin, ibuprofen, and\nPaxlovid). Thankfully, we don't need to know very many types of\nstructures in this course. Let's start with the linear hydrocarbons.\n\n### 5.2.1. Hydrocarbons: Counting to twelve in *Organic* Just like any\nother language, Organic has words corresponding to numbers of carbon\natoms. So, the words for the hydrocarbons of the general formula C\n$_{{n}}$ H $_{2{n}+2}$ as follows for $n$:\n\n1.  methane\n\n2.  ethane\n\n3.  propane\n\n4.  butane\n\n5.  pentane\n\n6.  hexane\n\n7.  heptane\n\n8.  octane\n\n9.  nonane\n\n10. decane\n\n11. undecane\n\n12. dodecane\n\nIf you need to count beyond 12, there is a pattern: tridecane,\ntetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane,\nnonadecane, and finally isocane for $n=20$.\n\nWhen converting the name of molecule to its structure, we usually leave\nout the carbon and hydrogen atoms. The reason is because they appear so\nregularly it would be tedious if we had to keep writing them. Instead,\nwe just draw the bonds---the atoms are implied. A carbon atom always has\nfour bonds. If the bonding partners are not shown, we assume that the\nremaining bonds are to hydrogen. Every vertex and terminus of the\nstructure signify a carbon atom. So, pentane, with the empirical formula\nC $_{5}$ H $_{12}$ , has the structure shown in Figure (5.1):\n\n(Figure 5.1) \n>>>image(pentane.png.0)\n\nVerify that you could draw the structures of any of the hydrocarbons\nwith $n=1-20$.\n",

Unnatural organic structures can contain many other\nelements, such as chlorine (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) or bromine.\n\nThe site where non-carbon elements are incorporated into an organic\nmolecule is called a **functional group**.

Technically, the monomers are called **monomer\nresidues** once incorporated into the backbone of a polymer, though this\nword is used mostly by biologists in reference to **amino acid\nresidues** that make up the linear structure of proteins.\n\n#### Polyolefins\n\nThe polymers polyethylene and poly(methylmethacrylate) shown in Figure\n(5.4) are called **polyolefins**, which means that they are derived from\nthe rearrangement of the $\\pi$ bonds of double bonded monomers to form\nthe polymer.[^5.5.1] A characteristic of such polymers is that the backbone\n*contains nothing but carbon atoms!* Most polymers that look like this\nare made industrially by a **radical, cationic**, or **anionic\nmechanism**, we will not go through these mechanisms in detail. Suffice\nit to say, radical mechanisms operate by splitting the $\\pi$ bond of the\nmonomer into two individual electrons, which link up to form the new\nbonds. Cationic polymerizations are mediated by the movement of a\npositive charge, and anionic polymerizations are mediated by the\nmovement of a negative charge.\n\n#### Polycondensation reactions\n\nThere are other polymers, however, which contain *heteroatoms* in the\nbackbone, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon. Some of the\nmost well known examples of these heteroatom-containing polymers are\nderived from carbonyl compounds, and form polymer with the carbonyls\nintact. Examples of nitrogen-containing polymers that follow this\npattern are nylon and Kevlar (Figure (5.6), below).\n\n(Figure 5.6) \n>>>image(polyamide.png.0)\n\nExamples of oxygen-containing polymers that follow this pattern are\npolycarbonate (used in eyeglasses) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)\n(PET, a.k.a. polyester, used in clothing and soda bottles, Figure\n(5.7)).\n\n(Figure 5.7) \n>>>image(PET.png.0)\n\nThe chemical process by which such materials are synthesized is known as\n**polycondensation**, Figure (5.8). A polycondensation reaction follows\nthe general formula, shown below. The key is that a small molecule\n(often either water or hydrochloric acid) is ejected for every monomer\nthat joins the chain. The reaction is termed a *condensation* because\nthe molecular weight of the polymer chain is less than the weight of all\nthe monomers by the amount of this ejected monomer.\n\n(Figure 5.8) \n>>>image(polycondensation.png.0)\n\n[^5.5.1]: **Olefin** was the old-timey name for alkene, or carbon-carbon\n    double bond. One might have said so in the first place!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 6: Polymerization kinetics: Chain-growth and step-growth\nA polymer chain can grow one of two ways, by a **chain-growth** process\n(a.k.a. **addition**) or by a **step-growth** process (a.k.a.\n**condensation**). In chain-growth processes, one monomer adds one at a\ntime to the growing chain end: monomers react only with growing chain\nends. Monomers do not react with each other except upon **initiation**,\nand polymer chains do not react with each other, except upon\n**termination**. Chain-growth processes can be further subdivided into\n**uncontrolled** or **controlled** reaction types. In step-growth\nprocesses, every monomer and polymer is reactive toward every other\nmonomer and polymer in the mixture. The growth process of a polymer\ndetermines its distribution of molecular weight and has a profound\ninfluence on the applications to which it is suited.\n\n### 5.6.1. Chain-growth: Uncontrolled\n\nOf the 370 million metric tons (\"tonnes\") of polymers produced annually\naround the globe, the vast majority are polyolefins, and around half of\nthese are synthesized by (uncontrolled) free-radical polymerization.\nThese materials are dominated by polyethylene (plastic bags and milk\njugs), polypropylene (carpet), poly(vinyl chloride) (pipes, shower\ncurtains, LP records), and polystyrene (styrofoam, plastic petri\ndishes). We will not go into the mechanism here, but the reaction\nproceeds by what I think of as the *popcorn mechanism*. Picture all the\nmonomers in a big steel reactor. A radical initiator is sprinkled in.\nEach initiator molecule, at some random time, causes a chain reaction.\nOne monomer reacts with the next to form a dimer, the dimer reacts with\nanother monomer to form a trimer, the trimer reacts with another monomer\nto form a tetramer. This process repeats hundreds or thousands of times\nuntil it stops abruptly by colliding with another molecule. Some\npolymers stop at 100 monomers, some stop at 500 or 10,000. The number of\nmonomer residues in a polymer chain is called the **degree of\npolymerization**, $i$, and in free radical polymerizations it is a\nstatistical assortment of sort-of random chain lengths. This randomness\nleads to a large distribution of degrees of polymerization or\n**dispersity**.[^5.6.1]\n\nBecause of the randomness with which each polymer chain initiates and\nspeed with which it grows once commenced, the reaction mixture consists\nof unreacted monomers, along with fully formed polymer chains, with very\nfew partly formed polymers. Thus, the average molecular weight, $M_{n}$,\nof polymer chains---excluding unreacted monomers---is reached quickly. I\ncall uncontrolled chain growth the *popcorn mechanism* because at any\nlocation, you have either a piece of popcorn---a polymer chain---or an\nunpopped kernel---a monomer. The \"pops\" occur in random locations in the\nreaction mixture. A conceptual drawing showing the wide range in\ndistribution of molecular weights is shown in the following, Figure\n(5.9).\n\n(Figure 5.9) \n>>>image(uncontrolled.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.2. Chain-growth: Controlled or \"living\"\n\nA controlled chain-growth process is one in which the polymerization is\nslowed to an extent that all polymer chains initiate at around the same\ntime, and then monomers add a few at a time to each growing polymer\nchain. Often, this type of process is called **living** (Figure (5.10)),\nmeaning that once one type of monomer is consumed, a second type of\nmonomer can be added into the reaction mixture, which then adds to the\ngrowing polymer chains.\n\n(Figure 5.10) \n>>>image(living.png.0)\n\n#### Block copolymers\n\nThus, it is possible to make polymers with *blocks* of each type of\nmonomer residue. Such a structure is called a **block copolymer**.\nPolymers with the structure AAAABBBBB etc. are called **diblock**\ncopolymers, and those of the type AAAABBBBCCCC are called **triblock**\ncopolymers. While most **homopolymers**[^5.6.2] phase separate when mixed\n(like oil and water), block copolymers do not. In fact, while the \"A\"\nblocks and the \"B\" blocks of block copolymers might \"prefer\" to be\nseparated, they are covalently linked and thus prevented from doing so.\nInstead, they form nanostructures of \"A domains\" inside of a continuous\nphase of B, or vice-versa.[^5.6.3] Typically, block copolymers give the\n\"best of both worlds\" in properties held by either block alone. In\ncontrast, physical blends of the two polymers (without covalent\nattachment) tends to give an averaging of the properties, which leads to\nmaterials having the \"worst of both worlds\" (e.g., of, say, strength and\nchemical resistance). Block copolymers are useful for many things, such\nas porous films for separation membranes, low-dielectric films for\ngraphics processors, and as **thermoplastic elastomers**[^5.6.4] for 3D\nprinting, e.g., poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), or SBS rubber.\n\n### 5.6.3. Step-growth polymerization\n\nIn contrast to chain-growth polymerization, in which monomers add to\ngrowing chains one at a time, in a step-growth process, anything goes.\nThat is, a monomer has two reactive ends and can react with any monomer\nor any growing chain in the soup. So, a dimer can add to a dimer to make\na tetramer, two tetramers can add to form an octomer, and basically\nanything in the mix an add to anything else at any time. As a result of\nthis process, it takes a long time (percentage of reacted functional\ngroups) for polymers to form with large molecular weights. That is, it's\nnot until the last few reactions that 50-mers form 100-mers, 100-mers\nform 200-mers, and so on.[^5.6.5] For most of the reaction, you have mostly\nshort oligomers. At the end, you have long polymers. The rough plot of\n$M_{n}$ vs. % reacted functional groups for step-growth polymerization\nprocesses looks like the plot shown in Figure (5.11).\n\n(Figure 5.11) \n>>>image(step-growth.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.4. A word about molecular weight\n\nThe molecular weight of a polymer can be described in various ways, the\ntwo most popular of which are the **number-average molecular weight**,\n$M_{n}$, and the **weight-average molecular weight**, $M_{w}$. The\nformer, $M_{n}$, is the conventional average. To get $M_n$, we add up\nthe weight of the entire sample of polymer and divides by the number of\nchains, as in equation (5.1):\n\n(Equation 5.1) $$M_n=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i}{\\Sigma N_i}$$\n\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of polymers with degree of polymerization $i$\nand $M_i$ is the mass of the chain with degree of polymerization $i$.\nThis method of calculating the average molecular weight can be\nmisleading, however. This method of calculating the molecular weight\ntends to over-value the contributions of low-molecular-weight chains in\nthe sample, even though most of the actual mass of the sample is made of\nhigher molecular weight stuff. For example, if a sample consisted of two\npolymer chains, one with a mass of 20 and one with a mass of 2,000,000,\nthen $M_n$ would be about 1,000,000, but the properties would be\ndominated by the chain which occupied the largest fraction of the\nsample, by mass. In fact, it would behave almost identically to a sample\nwith $M_n$ of 2,000,000. To account for this misleading result of using\nonly the $M_n$ to characterize the sample, we use $M_w$. This value\ngives you a number that reflects the weights of the polymer chains that\nrepresent the largest fraction of the sample, as in equation (5.2)\n\n(Equation 5.2)\n$$M_w=\\frac{\\Sigma w_i M_i}{\\Sigma w_i}=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i^2}{\\Sigma N_i M_i}$$\n\nwhere $w_i$ is the weight of the entire sample with degree of\npolymerization $i$, or $N_iM_i$. Molecular weight (any type) has the\nunits of g mol$^{-1}$ or Dalton, Da.\n\n#### Dispersity\n\nThe dispersity is defined as =$\\frac{M_w}{M_n}$, which is always\n$\\geq$ 1. The larger the number , the larger the distribution of\nmolecular weights. In general, as we will find in the next chapter,\nlarger s mean less internal order, lower **glass transition\ntemperatures**, and greater mechanical compliance.\n\n### 5.6.5. Polymers as nanomaterials\n\nPolymers are one of the most fundamental types of nanostructured\nmaterials: a single polymer chain in solution is, fundamentally, a\nnanoparticle. The characteristic size of a polymer chain in solution is\ngiven by its **radius of gyration**, $R_g$, which can be thought of as\nthe average distance[^5.6.6] of the monomer residues from the center of mass\nof the polymer blob, which approximates a sphere. The $R_g$ can\neffectively be treated as a measure of the size of the polymer blob in\nsolution.\n\nThe volume of a polymer blob can be thought of in two different ways.\nThe first way is to calculate the volume taken up by the polymer blob,\nincluding the solvent molecules, or $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_g^3$. The second\nway is to calculate the volume of the polymer strand, which can be\nvisualized as a long cylinder, like a piece of spaghetti. This volume is\napproximately 10% of the volume of the polymer blob, which means that\nthe total volume occupied by the blob is actually 90% solvent!\n\nThe size of the blob depends on the solvent. In a \"good\" solvent, which\nhas favorable interactions with the monomer residues of the polymer, the\nblob expands. In a \"bad\" solvent, the monomer residues prefer\ninteracting with themselves (and/or the solvent molecules prefer\ninteracting with themselves instead of the polymer), and the blob\ncontracts. In the middle, we have a **theta solvent**, which is a\nsolvent that is good enough to \"cancel out\" the van der Waals forces\nbetween the monomer residues, and the size of the polymer blob is\nsomewhere in between what it would be in a good solvent on one side and\na bad solvent on the other. You can think of a theta solvent as being\n\"invisible\" to the polymer blob. That is, the polymer chain behaves as\nif there were no van der Waals forces between the residues. Because the\nentropy of a polymer in solution---and thus its solubility---depends on\ntemperature, any solvent can be turned into a theta solvent at a\nspecific temperature, known as the **theta temperature**.\n\n### 5.6.6. Molecular weight determination\n\nThe molecular weight---either $M_n$ or $M_w$---is one of the most\nimportant parameters which characterizes a polymer sample. It can be\ndetermined in a number of ways, but rarely with complete accuracy. For\nexample, the viscosity of a polymer solution or melt increases with\nincreasing $M$ in a predictable way using **viscometry**. The most\ncommon methods however use the the size of the polymers in solution as a\nsubstitute for the molecular weight.\n\n#### Size-exclusion chromatography\n\nA versatile method for determining the molecular weight ($M_n$, $M_w$,\nand thus ) is based on the retention time of polymers in solution as it\npasses through a gel consisting of porous beads. In this method, the\nlarger polymer blobs go around the beads and **elute**[^5.6.7] first. The\nsmaller polymer blobs get temporarily stuck inside the pores within the\nbeads and come out later. This method is often referred to in polymer\nengineering as **gel-permeation chromatography (GPC)**, but is perhaps\nbetter described using a term for the same technique but which is used\nin biochemistry, **size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)**.\n\n### 5.6.7. Other characterization tools There are other\ncharacterization tools used in the determination of the molecular weight\nof polymers, including **dynamic light scattering** (DLS), which can be\nused to measure the sizes of particles based on the rate at which they\nget closer together and farther apart due to random Brownian motion.\nAnother technique is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry (**MALDI-TOF-MS**). In MALDI-TOF-MS,\nthe polymer is coated on a thin polymeric matrix which is blasted with\ncharged particles. The matrix and the polymer of interest are fragmented\nby the beam and accelerated toward a detector. The amount of time that\nit takes to reach the detector is based on the ratio of mass to charge.\nFrom these data, it is usually possible to determine the mass of the\nlargest fragment, which often corresponds to that of the entire polymer\nchain. Finally, the sizes of polymer blobs can be obtained by\nmeasurements of **osmotic pressure**. In this method, the pressure\ngenerated through a semi-permeable membrane can be related to the size\nand molecular weight of the polymer blobs.\n\n[^5.6.1]: The dispersity used to be called the *polydispersity*, but then\n    IUPAC decided this word was redundant.\n\n[^5.6.2]: A retronym meaning \"not a copolymer.\"\n\n[^5.6.3]: A quick Google search for \"block copolymer nanostructure\" will\n    show some of the intricate nanoscale patters that can be achieved.\n\n[^5.6.4]: Rubber that can be melted and reformed\n\n[^5.6.5]: I'm not sure who said this first, but I attribute it to Lieutenant\n    Sulu on *Star Trek*: If you have a penny and double it every day for\n    a month, you'll be poor for most of that month, but at the end of\n    the month you'll be a millionaire.\n\n[^5.6.6]: Technically the root-mean squared distance.\n\n[^5.6.7]: come out\n",

      "content": "#### Section 4: Chemical reactivity\nIn this course, we have taken a relaxed definition of the word \"bond\"\nsuch that it includes van der Waals bonds and other electrostatic\ninteractions. In this section, we will briefly mention the types of\nbonds that form in traditional chemical systems. That is, those that\ninvolve the movement or formal sharing or transfer of electrons.\n\n### 5.4.1. Electrostatic attraction and ionic bonding The most basic\ntype of bond is the one described in subsection (2.1.1). This is a\nclassic ionic bond between oppositely charged species that obeys\nCoulomb's law of electrostatic attraction. There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 5: Polymers as molecules and nanostructures\nPolymeric materials are ubiquitous in nanoengineering applications. For\nexample, as **photoresists** (the light-sensitive chemicals used in\nmicroelectronics fabrication), as **drug-delivery nanoparticles**, as\n**biomaterials** for regenerative medicine, as the charge-transport or\nencapsulation layers in **thin-film photovoltaic cells**, and as\ncomponents of **nanocomposite aerospace materials**. Compared to\ninorganic solids, polymers offer greater mechanical strength and\ntoughness, light weight, and synthetic tunability for biocompatibility,\nlight emission and absorption, chemical sensitivity, mechanical\ncompliance, and many other useful attributes.\n\nThere are two ways in which we can consider the properties of polymers.\nThe first way---discussed in this chapter---treats polymers as chemical\nobjects. That is, molecules or nanomaterials having properties like\ndipole moment, molecular weight, and polarizability. The second\nway---discussed in the next chapter---treats polymers as solid materials\nhaving bulk properties. That is, density, modulus, and conductivity.\n\n### 5.5.1. Structure of polymers\n\nExemplars of polymer synthesis are shown in Figure (5.4). Polymers are\nnamed after the monomer, whether or not something that looks like the\nmonomer is actually incorporated into the backbone of the polymer. For\nexample, in the synthesis of polyethylene, the monomer ethylene contains\na double bond, whereas the bonds in polyethylene are all single bonds.\nThe double bond in the monomer is needed because the electrons involved\nin the $\\pi$ bond of the double bond are needed to form the new single\nbond between monomers. Technically, the monomers are called **monomer\nresidues** once incorporated into the backbone of a polymer, though this\nword is used mostly by biologists in reference to **amino acid\nresidues** that make up the linear structure of proteins.\n\n#### Polyolefins\n\nThe polymers polyethylene and poly(methylmethacrylate) shown in Figure\n(5.4) are called **polyolefins**, which means that they are derived from\nthe rearrangement of the $\\pi$ bonds of double bonded monomers to form\nthe polymer.[^5.5.1] A characteristic of such polymers is that the backbone\n*contains nothing but carbon atoms!* Most polymers that look like this\nare made industrially by a **radical, cationic**, or **anionic\nmechanism**, we will not go through these mechanisms in detail. Suffice\nit to say, radical mechanisms operate by splitting the $\\pi$ bond of the\nmonomer into two individual electrons, which link up to form the new\nbonds. Cationic polymerizations are mediated by the movement of a\npositive charge, and anionic polymerizations are mediated by the\nmovement of a negative charge.\n\n#### Polycondensation reactions\n\nThere are other polymers, however, which contain *heteroatoms* in the\nbackbone, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon. Some of the\nmost well known examples of these heteroatom-containing polymers are\nderived from carbonyl compounds, and form polymer with the carbonyls\nintact. Examples of nitrogen-containing polymers that follow this\npattern are nylon and Kevlar (Figure (5.6), below).\n\n(Figure 5.6) \n>>>image(polyamide.png.0)\n\nExamples of oxygen-containing polymers that follow this pattern are\npolycarbonate (used in eyeglasses) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)\n(PET, a.k.a. polyester, used in clothing and soda bottles, Figure\n(5.7)).\n\n(Figure 5.7) \n>>>image(PET.png.0)\n\nThe chemical process by which such materials are synthesized is known as\n**polycondensation**, Figure (5.8). A polycondensation reaction follows\nthe general formula, shown below. The key is that a small molecule\n(often either water or hydrochloric acid) is ejected for every monomer\nthat joins the chain. The reaction is termed a *condensation* because\nthe molecular weight of the polymer chain is less than the weight of all\nthe monomers by the amount of this ejected monomer.\n\n(Figure 5.8) \n>>>image(polycondensation.png.0)\n\n[^5.5.1]: **Olefin** was the old-timey name for alkene, or carbon-carbon\n    double bond. One might have said so in the first place!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 6: Polymerization kinetics: Chain-growth and step-growth\nA polymer chain can grow one of two ways, by a **chain-growth** process\n(a.k.a. **addition**) or by a **step-growth** process (a.k.a.\n**condensation**). In chain-growth processes, one monomer adds one at a\ntime to the growing chain end: monomers react only with growing chain\nends. Monomers do not react with each other except upon **initiation**,\nand polymer chains do not react with each other, except upon\n**termination**. Chain-growth processes can be further subdivided into\n**uncontrolled** or **controlled** reaction types. In step-growth\nprocesses, every monomer and polymer is reactive toward every other\nmonomer and polymer in the mixture. The growth process of a polymer\ndetermines its distribution of molecular weight and has a profound\ninfluence on the applications to which it is suited.\n\n### 5.6.1. Chain-growth: Uncontrolled\n\nOf the 370 million metric tons (\"tonnes\") of polymers produced annually\naround the globe, the vast majority are polyolefins, and around half of\nthese are synthesized by (uncontrolled) free-radical polymerization.\nThese materials are dominated by polyethylene (plastic bags and milk\njugs), polypropylene (carpet), poly(vinyl chloride) (pipes, shower\ncurtains, LP records), and polystyrene (styrofoam, plastic petri\ndishes). We will not go into the mechanism here, but the reaction\nproceeds by what I think of as the *popcorn mechanism*. Picture all the\nmonomers in a big steel reactor. A radical initiator is sprinkled in.\nEach initiator molecule, at some random time, causes a chain reaction.\nOne monomer reacts with the next to form a dimer, the dimer reacts with\nanother monomer to form a trimer, the trimer reacts with another monomer\nto form a tetramer. This process repeats hundreds or thousands of times\nuntil it stops abruptly by colliding with another molecule. Some\npolymers stop at 100 monomers, some stop at 500 or 10,000. The number of\nmonomer residues in a polymer chain is called the **degree of\npolymerization**, $i$, and in free radical polymerizations it is a\nstatistical assortment of sort-of random chain lengths. This randomness\nleads to a large distribution of degrees of polymerization or\n**dispersity**.[^5.6.1]\n\nBecause of the randomness with which each polymer chain initiates and\nspeed with which it grows once commenced, the reaction mixture consists\nof unreacted monomers, along with fully formed polymer chains, with very\nfew partly formed polymers. Thus, the average molecular weight, $M_{n}$,\nof polymer chains---excluding unreacted monomers---is reached quickly. I\ncall uncontrolled chain growth the *popcorn mechanism* because at any\nlocation, you have either a piece of popcorn---a polymer chain---or an\nunpopped kernel---a monomer. The \"pops\" occur in random locations in the\nreaction mixture. A conceptual drawing showing the wide range in\ndistribution of molecular weights is shown in the following, Figure\n(5.9).\n\n(Figure 5.9) \n>>>image(uncontrolled.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.2. Chain-growth: Controlled or \"living\"\n\nA controlled chain-growth process is one in which the polymerization is\nslowed to an extent that all polymer chains initiate at around the same\ntime, and then monomers add a few at a time to each growing polymer\nchain. Often, this type of process is called **living** (Figure (5.10)),\nmeaning that once one type of monomer is consumed, a second type of\nmonomer can be added into the reaction mixture, which then adds to the\ngrowing polymer chains.\n\n(Figure 5.10) \n>>>image(living.png.0)\n\n#### Block copolymers\n\nThus, it is possible to make polymers with *blocks* of each type of\nmonomer residue. Such a structure is called a **block copolymer**.\nPolymers with the structure AAAABBBBB etc. are called **diblock**\ncopolymers, and those of the type AAAABBBBCCCC are called **triblock**\ncopolymers. While most **homopolymers**[^5.6.2] phase separate when mixed\n(like oil and water), block copolymers do not. In fact, while the \"A\"\nblocks and the \"B\" blocks of block copolymers might \"prefer\" to be\nseparated, they are covalently linked and thus prevented from doing so.\nInstead, they form nanostructures of \"A domains\" inside of a continuous\nphase of B, or vice-versa.[^5.6.3] Typically, block copolymers give the\n\"best of both worlds\" in properties held by either block alone. In\ncontrast, physical blends of the two polymers (without covalent\nattachment) tends to give an averaging of the properties, which leads to\nmaterials having the \"worst of both worlds\" (e.g., of, say, strength and\nchemical resistance). Block copolymers are useful for many things, such\nas porous films for separation membranes, low-dielectric films for\ngraphics processors, and as **thermoplastic elastomers**[^5.6.4] for 3D\nprinting, e.g., poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), or SBS rubber.\n\n### 5.6.3. Step-growth polymerization\n\nIn contrast to chain-growth polymerization, in which monomers add to\ngrowing chains one at a time, in a step-growth process, anything goes.\nThat is, a monomer has two reactive ends and can react with any monomer\nor any growing chain in the soup. So, a dimer can add to a dimer to make\na tetramer, two tetramers can add to form an octomer, and basically\nanything in the mix an add to anything else at any time. As a result of\nthis process, it takes a long time (percentage of reacted functional\ngroups) for polymers to form with large molecular weights. That is, it's\nnot until the last few reactions that 50-mers form 100-mers, 100-mers\nform 200-mers, and so on.[^5.6.5] For most of the reaction, you have mostly\nshort oligomers. At the end, you have long polymers. The rough plot of\n$M_{n}$ vs. % reacted functional groups for step-growth polymerization\nprocesses looks like the plot shown in Figure (5.11).\n\n(Figure 5.11) \n>>>image(step-growth.png.0)\n\n### 5.6.4. A word about molecular weight\n\nThe molecular weight of a polymer can be described in various ways, the\ntwo most popular of which are the **number-average molecular weight**,\n$M_{n}$, and the **weight-average molecular weight**, $M_{w}$. The\nformer, $M_{n}$, is the conventional average. To get $M_n$, we add up\nthe weight of the entire sample of polymer and divides by the number of\nchains, as in equation (5.1):\n\n(Equation 5.1) $$M_n=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i}{\\Sigma N_i}$$\n\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of polymers with degree of polymerization $i$\nand $M_i$ is the mass of the chain with degree of polymerization $i$.\nThis method of calculating the average molecular weight can be\nmisleading, however. This method of calculating the molecular weight\ntends to over-value the contributions of low-molecular-weight chains in\nthe sample, even though most of the actual mass of the sample is made of\nhigher molecular weight stuff. For example, if a sample consisted of two\npolymer chains, one with a mass of 20 and one with a mass of 2,000,000,\nthen $M_n$ would be about 1,000,000, but the properties would be\ndominated by the chain which occupied the largest fraction of the\nsample, by mass. In fact, it would behave almost identically to a sample\nwith $M_n$ of 2,000,000. To account for this misleading result of using\nonly the $M_n$ to characterize the sample, we use $M_w$. This value\ngives you a number that reflects the weights of the polymer chains that\nrepresent the largest fraction of the sample, as in equation (5.2)\n\n(Equation 5.2)\n$$M_w=\\frac{\\Sigma w_i M_i}{\\Sigma w_i}=\\frac{\\Sigma N_i M_i^2}{\\Sigma N_i M_i}$$\n\nwhere $w_i$ is the weight of the entire sample with degree of\npolymerization $i$, or $N_iM_i$. Molecular weight (any type) has the\nunits of g mol$^{-1}$ or Dalton, Da.\n\n#### Dispersity\n\nThe dispersity is defined as =$\\frac{M_w}{M_n}$, which is always\n$\\geq$ 1. The larger the number , the larger the distribution of\nmolecular weights. In general, as we will find in the next chapter,\nlarger s mean less internal order, lower **glass transition\ntemperatures**, and greater mechanical compliance.\n\n### 5.6.5. Polymers as nanomaterials\n\nPolymers are one of the most fundamental types of nanostructured\nmaterials: a single polymer chain in solution is, fundamentally, a\nnanoparticle. The characteristic size of a polymer chain in solution is\ngiven by its **radius of gyration**, $R_g$, which can be thought of as\nthe average distance[^5.6.6] of the monomer residues from the center of mass\nof the polymer blob, which approximates a sphere. The $R_g$ can\neffectively be treated as a measure of the size of the polymer blob in\nsolution.\n\nThe volume of a polymer blob can be thought of in two different ways.\nThe first way is to calculate the volume taken up by the polymer blob,\nincluding the solvent molecules, or $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_g^3$. The second\nway is to calculate the volume of the polymer strand, which can be\nvisualized as a long cylinder, like a piece of spaghetti. This volume is\napproximately 10% of the volume of the polymer blob, which means that\nthe total volume occupied by the blob is actually 90% solvent!\n\nThe size of the blob depends on the solvent. In a \"good\" solvent, which\nhas favorable interactions with the monomer residues of the polymer, the\nblob expands. In a \"bad\" solvent, the monomer residues prefer\ninteracting with themselves (and/or the solvent molecules prefer\ninteracting with themselves instead of the polymer), and the blob\ncontracts. In the middle, we have a **theta solvent**, which is a\nsolvent that is good enough to \"cancel out\" the van der Waals forces\nbetween the monomer residues, and the size of the polymer blob is\nsomewhere in between what it would be in a good solvent on one side and\na bad solvent on the other. You can think of a theta solvent as being\n\"invisible\" to the polymer blob. That is, the polymer chain behaves as\nif there were no van der Waals forces between the residues. Because the\nentropy of a polymer in solution---and thus its solubility---depends on\ntemperature, any solvent can be turned into a theta solvent at a\nspecific temperature, known as the **theta temperature**.\n\n### 5.6.6. Molecular weight determination\n\nThe molecular weight---either $M_n$ or $M_w$---is one of the most\nimportant parameters which characterizes a polymer sample. It can be\ndetermined in a number of ways, but rarely with complete accuracy. For\nexample, the viscosity of a polymer solution or melt increases with\nincreasing $M$ in a predictable way using **viscometry**. The most\ncommon methods however use the the size of the polymers in solution as a\nsubstitute for the molecular weight.\n\n#### Size-exclusion chromatography\n\nA versatile method for determining the molecular weight ($M_n$, $M_w$,\nand thus ) is based on the retention time of polymers in solution as it\npasses through a gel consisting of porous beads. In this method, the\nlarger polymer blobs go around the beads and **elute**[^5.6.7] first. The\nsmaller polymer blobs get temporarily stuck inside the pores within the\nbeads and come out later. This method is often referred to in polymer\nengineering as **gel-permeation chromatography (GPC)**, but is perhaps\nbetter described using a term for the same technique but which is used\nin biochemistry, **size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)**.\n\n### 5.6.7. Other characterization tools There are other\ncharacterization tools used in the determination of the molecular weight\nof polymers, including **dynamic light scattering** (DLS), which can be\nused to measure the sizes of particles based on the rate at which they\nget closer together and farther apart due to random Brownian motion.\nAnother technique is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry (**MALDI-TOF-MS**). In MALDI-TOF-MS,\nthe polymer is coated on a thin polymeric matrix which is blasted with\ncharged particles. The matrix and the polymer of interest are fragmented\nby the beam and accelerated toward a detector. The amount of time that\nit takes to reach the detector is based on the ratio of mass to charge.\nFrom these data, it is usually possible to determine the mass of the\nlargest fragment, which often corresponds to that of the entire polymer\nchain. Finally, the sizes of polymer blobs can be obtained by\nmeasurements of **osmotic pressure**. In this method, the pressure\ngenerated through a semi-permeable membrane can be related to the size\nand molecular weight of the polymer blobs.\n\n[^5.6.1]: The dispersity used to be called the *polydispersity*, but then\n    IUPAC decided this word was redundant.\n\n[^5.6.2]: A retronym meaning \"not a copolymer.\"\n\n[^5.6.3]: A quick Google search for \"block copolymer nanostructure\" will\n    show some of the intricate nanoscale patters that can be achieved.\n\n[^5.6.4]: Rubber that can be melted and reformed\n\n[^5.6.5]: I'm not sure who said this first, but I attribute it to Lieutenant\n    Sulu on *Star Trek*: If you have a penny and double it every day for\n    a month, you'll be poor for most of that month, but at the end of\n    the month you'll be a millionaire.\n\n[^5.6.6]: Technically the root-mean squared distance.\n\n[^5.6.7]: come out\n",

We will call this language *Organic*. It operates by the\nnomenclature established by the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC). However, by describing chemical structures only in\nwords, the IUPAC name gets really long even for simple compounds. In\nfact, most chemists don't use IUPAC names for any but the most basic\nstructures (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, and butane). After all, it\nis almost always easier to just draw the structure. Moreover, most\ncomplicated structures have common names (like aspirin, ibuprofen, and\nPaxlovid). Thankfully, we don't need to know very many types of\nstructures in this course. Let's start with the linear hydrocarbons.\n\n### 5.2.1. Hydrocarbons: Counting to twelve in *Organic* Just like any\nother language, Organic has words corresponding to numbers of carbon\natoms. So, the words for the hydrocarbons of the general formula C\n$_{{n}}$ H $_{2{n}+2}$ as follows for $n$:\n\n1.  methane\n\n2.  ethane\n\n3.  propane\n\n4.  butane\n\n5.  pentane\n\n6.  hexane\n\n7.  heptane\n\n8.  octane\n\n9.  nonane\n\n10. decane\n\n11. undecane\n\n12. dodecane\n\nIf you need to count beyond 12, there is a pattern: tridecane,\ntetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane,\nnonadecane, and finally isocane for $n=20$.\n\nWhen converting the name of molecule to its structure, we usually leave\nout the carbon and hydrogen atoms. The reason is because they appear so\nregularly it would be tedious if we had to keep writing them. Instead,\nwe just draw the bonds---the atoms are implied. A carbon atom always has\nfour bonds. If the bonding partners are not shown, we assume that the\nremaining bonds are to hydrogen. Every vertex and terminus of the\nstructure signify a carbon atom. So, pentane, with the empirical formula\nC $_{5}$ H $_{12}$ , has the structure shown in Figure (5.1):\n\n(Figure 5.1) \n>>>image(pentane.png.0)\n\nVerify that you could draw the structures of any of the hydrocarbons\nwith $n=1-20$.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Functional groups\nMolecules with carbon-containing backbones are called **organic\nmolecules**. The most common elements beside carbon and hydrogen\nincorporated into organic molecules that occur naturally are oxygen and\nnitrogen, and to a lesser extent, phosphorous (e.g., found in the\nbackbone of DNA) and sulfur (e.g., found in the amino acids cysteine and\nmethionine). Unnatural organic structures can contain many other\nelements, such as chlorine (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) or bromine.\n\nThe site where non-carbon elements are incorporated into an organic\nmolecule is called a **functional group**. These groups are called\n*functional* because they often dictate the properties---thermodynamic\nproperties like melting and boiling point, along with chemical\nproperties like reactivity---of the molecule. It is not uncommon for\nmolecules to have many functional groups. The most common functional\ngroups you will encounter are shown in Figure (5.2), below.\n\n(Figure 5.2) \n>>>image(functional groups.png.0)\n\nR represents any group or part of a molecule, with the expectation that\nthe first atom of the R group is carbon. The C=O (double bond) subunit\nof acids, amides, and esters is called a **carbonyl**. All of the\nfunctional groups in this list are polar---capable of bonding by\ndipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole forces---and alcohols, amines,\ncarboxylic acids, and amides are donors of hydrogen bonds. All five\nstructures are also capable of accepting hydrogen bonds through the lone\npairs on the oxygen atom of the carbonyl, or through the nitrogen atom\n(for amines).\n",

      "content": "#### Section 4: Chemical reactivity\nIn this course, we have taken a relaxed definition of the word \"bond\"\nsuch that it includes van der Waals bonds and other electrostatic\ninteractions. In this section, we will briefly mention the types of\nbonds that form in traditional chemical systems. That is, those that\ninvolve the movement or formal sharing or transfer of electrons.\n\n### 5.4.1. Electrostatic attraction and ionic bonding The most basic\ntype of bond is the one described in subsection (2.1.1). This is a\nclassic ionic bond between oppositely charged species that obeys\nCoulomb's law of electrostatic attraction. There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",
