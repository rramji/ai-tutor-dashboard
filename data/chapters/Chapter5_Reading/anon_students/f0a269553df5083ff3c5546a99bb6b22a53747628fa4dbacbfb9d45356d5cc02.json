The most common elements beside carbon and hydrogen\nincorporated into organic molecules that occur naturally are oxygen and\nnitrogen, and to a lesser extent, phosphorous (e.g., found in the\nbackbone of DNA) and sulfur (e.g., found in the amino acids cysteine and\nmethionine). Unnatural organic structures can contain many other\nelements, such as chlorine (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) or bromine.\n\nThe site where non-carbon elements are incorporated into an organic\nmolecule is called a **functional group**. These groups are called\n*functional* because they often dictate the properties---thermodynamic\nproperties like melting and boiling point, along with chemical\nproperties like reactivity---of the molecule. It is not uncommon for\nmolecules to have many functional groups. The most common functional\ngroups you will encounter are shown in Figure (5.2), below.\n\n(Figure 5.2) \n>>>image(functional groups.png.0)\n\nR represents any group or part of a molecule, with the expectation that\nthe first atom of the R group is carbon. The C=O (double bond) subunit\nof acids, amides, and esters is called a **carbonyl**. All of the\nfunctional groups in this list are polar---capable of bonding by\ndipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole forces---and alcohols, amines,\ncarboxylic acids, and amides are donors of hydrogen bonds. All five\nstructures are also capable of accepting hydrogen bonds through the lone\npairs on the oxygen atom of the carbonyl, or through the nitrogen atom\n(for amines).\n",

      "content": "#### Section 4: Chemical reactivity\nIn this course, we have taken a relaxed definition of the word \"bond\"\nsuch that it includes van der Waals bonds and other electrostatic\ninteractions. In this section, we will briefly mention the types of\nbonds that form in traditional chemical systems. That is, those that\ninvolve the movement or formal sharing or transfer of electrons.\n\n### 5.4.1. Electrostatic attraction and ionic bonding The most basic\ntype of bond is the one described in subsection (2.1.1). This is a\nclassic ionic bond between oppositely charged species that obeys\nCoulomb's law of electrostatic attraction. There is no formal sharing of\nelectrons; they simply attract and get stuck to each other because\nthat's what objects with opposite charges do. The quintessential example\nis the \"bonding\" of a sodium ion and a chloride ion to get\nNa$^{+}+$Cl$^-$=NaCl. In some cases, such an interaction arises because\nof a formal **electron transfer** reaction. For example, if a neutral\nsodium atom (Na$^0$) came in close proximity to a neutral chlorine atom\n(Cl$^0$), then an electron would jump from the sodium atom to the\nchlorine atom. The sodium atom would be oxidized to Na$^+$ and the\nchlorine atom would be reduced to Cl$^-$. Once formally charged in this\nway, the ions would interact electrostatically.[^5.4.1]\n\n### 5.4.2. Reactivity arising from functional groups Functional groups\nreact with one another by moving electrons around to form new covalent\nbonds. In the zig-zag drawings, each bond represents a pair of\nelectrons. In covalent bonds like C-H, C-C, or C-F, one electron comes\nfrom one atom of the bonded pair, and one electron comes from the\nother.[^5.4.2] Chemical reactions are **quantum mechanical**, meaning that\nthe electrons occupy an **orbital** whose shape and energy level are\npredicted by solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or more complicated\nmathematical techniques.[^5.4.3] Regardless of these complexities, the\nmovement of electrons can often be predicted by electrostatics. That is,\natoms bearing partial negative charges are drawn to atoms bearing\npartial positive charges. A partial charge is generated any time two\natoms with unequal electronegativities are bonded to each other. In this\ncase, the electrons attached to the atom with the partial negative\ncharge---the **nucleophile**---move to bond with the atom with the\npartial positive charge---the **electrophile**---to form a bond. In\nFigure (5.3), below, the oxygen atom attacks the carbon atom at a\npolarized C--Br bond to form an **ether bond**.\n\n(Figure 5.3) \n>>>image(sn2.png.0)\n\nWhile we often associate functional groups with the presence of\n**heteroatoms**---atoms other than carbon or hydrogen---it turns out\nthat double and triple bonds between carbon atoms are also reactive to\nform new bonds. This reactivity arises from the properties of $\\pi$\nbonds, which run parallel (but separated from) the $\\sigma$ bond that\ndefines the internuclear axis (i.e., the line connecting the elements).\nSuch functional groups based on double and triple bonds are particularly\nimportant for applications in nanoengineering. For example, polymers and\npolymeric nanoparticles are produced by the reaction of double bonds to\nform polymers, as shown in Figure (5.4), below.\n\n(Figure 5.4) \n>>>image(polymerization.png.0)\n\nAdditionally, triple bonds (called **alkynes**) and azides (--N $_{3}$ )\nform a linkage called a triazole in a copper-catalyzed reaction called a\nHuisgen cycloaddition,[^5.4.4] meaning that the reaction forms a ring. This\nreaction is so sure-fire, quick, and irreversible, it is one of the most\nfamous examples of a transformation called a **click reaction**, Figure\n(5.5). This process has been used to bind proteins and drugs to\nnanoparticles, nanoparticles to each other, and molecules to surfaces.\nThe azide-alkyne cycloaddition is not the only click reaction, but it is\nthe most famous, and usually the one people are talking about.\n\n(Figure 5.5) \n>>>image(click.png.0)\n\nIf you have taken a class in organic chemistry, you probably encountered\ncurly arrows or \"arrow-pushing mechanisms.\" That is, the way organic\nchemists account for the movement of all of the electrons in a reaction.\nIn this class---and in many applications in nanoengineering---it is more\nuseful to think of functional groups as Lego blocks or Tetris pieces.\nThat is, they fit only with specific reaction partners. Just know that\nelectrons are never created nor destroyed in these processes, and people\nactually do know how to account for all the electrons.\n\nIt is also useful to remember a few things to avoid the most common\nerrors when considering the products of chemical reactions. Among them:\n\n1.  Carbon usually has four bonds, never five\n\n2.  Oxygen has two bonds; if it has three, it gets a positive charge,\n    and if it has one, it gets a negative charge\n\n3.  Nitrogen has three bonds; if it has four, then it gets a positive\n    charge\n\n[^5.4.1]: Prior to the transfer of the electron, the neutral atoms would\n    interact by London dispersion. The transfer of the electron followed\n    by strong interaction by ionic bonding is called the **harpoon\n    effect**.\n\n[^5.4.2]: Recall the octet rule from high school chemistry.\n\n[^5.4.3]: More on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to come in Chapter 8!\n\n[^5.4.4]: You *definitely* don't need to know this name.\n",
