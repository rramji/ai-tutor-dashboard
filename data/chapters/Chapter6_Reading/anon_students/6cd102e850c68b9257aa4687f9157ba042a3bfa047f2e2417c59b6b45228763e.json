      "content": "#### Section 1: Introduction\nWhen solidified by evaporation of a solvent (e.g., paint) or by cooling\nfrom a molten goo, polymers---*plastics*---form a wide variety of useful\nobjects. In fact, in an indoor environment, many objects are either made\nof or coated with a polymer. These plastic objects and coatings have\nproperties which derive from their molecular structures but which are\nalso determined by how those molecular structures pack in the solid\nstate. For example, is the object mostly crystalline? Totally amorphous?\nOr somewhere in between? These details determine the thermal stability\nand mechanical response of plastic objects in profound ways, as\ndiscussed here. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/JlasquVHyZ4)\n\nIn the last chapter, we explored the synthesis of polymers, starting\nwith basic organic building blocks, and ways to characterize their\nproperties in solution. Indeed, polymers in solution are central to many\nof the most modern, high-value and technologically sophisticated\nproducts of nanoengineering. For example, lipid nanoparticles\nincorporated with polymers like poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are the basis\nof the delivery vehicles for mRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19.\nPolymers in solution also comprise **photoresists** used in\nmicroelectronics manufacturing, paint and dye formulations, anticancer\ntherapeutics that evade immune detection and target cancer cells, and\nmaterials used in hydraulic fracturing in the recovery of natural gas.\nHowever, the vast majority of polymers are used to form solids, which\nhave distinctive properties owing to their highly **entangled**\nmicrostructure. Such properties include high tensile strength relative\nto weight, mechanical toughness, heat resistance, and **thermosetting**\nand **thermoplastic** properties, which allow polymeric materials to be\nformed into complex 3D objects much more easily than can be ceramics or\nmetals. In this chapter, we explore how the molecular structure of a\npolymer influences its morphology and properties in the solid state.\n\n#### Van der Waals solids\n\nA bowl of sugar (sucrose) is made up of many fine crystals. These\ncrystals are highly ordered and have a repeating structure which\ncontinues in all directions. Such a crystal diffracts X-rays (**Bragg\ndiffraction**) from which its structure and the spacing between all its\natoms can be determined. The individual sucrose molecules are held\ntogether by van der Waals forces, including hydrogen bonds, and the\nstructure is thus known as a **van der Waals solid**.[^6.1.1] Owing to its\nunique bonding arrangement, a polymeric solid has some properties of a\ncovalent solid and some properties of a van der Waals solid. For\nexample, the monomer residues within a chain are bonded covalently,\nwhile the monomers associate with each other through space by van der\nWaals interactions.\n\n#### Polymers: A special class of van der Waals solids\n\nA polymer can be solidified in one of two ways: (1) cooling from the\nmelt or (2) precipitation of solid polymer from solution upon\nevaporation of the solvent. As a polymer solidifies, many different\ntypes of structures can form. These structures depend on the molecular\nstructure of the polymer, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of\nsolidification. In general, a polymer forms **crystalline phases** and\n**amorphous phases**, with significant polymorphism possible (see Figure\n(6.1)).[^6.1.2] Thus, different samples of the same material can have\ndifferences in density in the amorphous phases and crystal structure in\neither phase. Crystalline phases are characterized by the **melting\ntemperature**, $T_m$, while amorphous phases are characterized by the\n**glass-transition temperature**, $T_g$.\n\n(Figure 6.1) \n>>>image(phases.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.1. The crystalline phase\n\nCrystalline phases of polymers have regular repeating structures. The\npresence of crystalline phases can be determined definitively by\ndiffraction of X-ray radiation (see Chapter 14). Such a structure is\nonly possible for polymers that have a regular molecular structure; any\nrandomness tends to destroy the potential for crystallinity. An example\nof a polymer which has multiple **stereoisomers**[^6.1.3] is polypropylene,\nwhich can exist in three basic isomers: **isotactic**, **syndiotactic**,\nand **atactic** (Figure (6.2)).\n\n(Figure 6.2) \n>>>image(tacticity.png.0)\n\nOf the three stereoisomers of polypropylene, only isotactic (all methyl\ngroups oriented the same way) and syndiotactc (methyl groups alternate\norientations) can crystallize. Atactic molecules have random\norientations of the methyl groups and thus cannot pack efficiently\nenough to crystallize. In practice, only isotactic and syndiotactic\npolypropylene are usable as solid materials, which can be used in\npackaging material, textiles (especially carpeting), and consumer\nelectronic devices; atactic polypropylene is a gummy material used as\nadhesives, sealants, and as components of asphalt. However, atactic\nchains can be combined by physical mixing or copolymerization with\nisotactic or syndiotactic material to tune the mechanical properties\ntoward being softer.\n\nWhen we say that a polymeric solid is crystalline, we are typically only\never talking about 30-80% crystalline. Such a sample is technically\ntermed **semicrystalline**. The reasons that a polymeric solid cannot be\ncompletely crystalline is because the ability of adjacent molecules to\nline up, end-to-end, with each other *exactly* cannot be guaranteed;\nmoreover, it is statistically nearly impossible, even for a completely\nmonodisperse sample (= 1.00000). Any dispersity whatsoever creates\nnon-overlapping chain ends and regions of **free volume** due to\ninefficient packing, decreased density, and increased mobility of\nchains. At least locally, such a region will not be crystalline.\n\nCrystalline regions of a polymer undergo a first-order phase transition\nat a specific temperature, $T_m$. The behavior of the solid observed at\nthis temperature is exactly analogous to what is observed in metallic,\nionic, or van der Waals solids. That is, the material fairly abruptly\ngoes from a solid to a liquid, with concomitant changes in **density**\n(usually decreases[^6.1.4]) and **heat capacity** (increases[^6.1.5]).\nMacroscopically, the polymer melt will not be a free-flowing liquid.\nRather, it will be a **viscoelastic liquid**, meaning that one may still\nobserve some elastic rebound if it is poked. This **viscoelastic\nbehavior** occurs because of the timescales needed to translate polymer\nchains. It literally takes on the orders of seconds, minutes, or\nhours---i.e., \"human\" timescales---for melted polymer chains to\nreorganize themselves in response to a load.\n\nThere are many types of crystalline phases possible in a polymer sample.\nFor example, stretching or shearing a polymer during solidification or\nfrom the melt often produces highly **anisotropic**[^6.1.6] structures in\nwhich the molecules line up along the stretched axis in a crystalline\nmorphology. Such a structure is produced by the *nylon rope trick*[^6.1.7]\nand is often called a shish-kebab because of the formation of roughly\ncylindrical nodules along the stretched axis. Other highly anisotropic\nstructures, nanofibers, nanowires, dendritic crystals, and\n\"shish-kebabs,\"[^6.1.8] see Figure (6.3).\n\n(Figure 6.3) \n>>>image(crystals.png.0)\n\nThe canonical crystalline structure for most reasonably flexible polymer\nchains---i.e., most polyolefins---is the **spherulite**, as illustrated\nin Figure (6.4). A spherulite resembles a three-dimensional snowflake.\nIt is a hyperbranched structure that nucleates and then propagates in\nall directions, continually branching all the way. Despite its name, the\nspherulite is rarely spherical, simply because nearby spherulites\nimpinge on each other and limit their growth. Picture blowing soap\nbubbles using a children's bubble wand. Occassionally, some bubbles will\ncome out as a blob of bubbles, none of which are completely spherical.\nMoreover, in confined geometries like thin films, the growth of the\nspherulite in the z-axis is constrained, and thus the spherulite grows\nin two dimensions only. The presence of these structures can be easily\nidentified by optical microscopy under cross-polarization.[^6.1.9] The image\none sees is called a **Maltese cross**.\n\n(Figure 6.4) \n>>>image(spherulite.png.0)\n\nFor flexible polymers like polyolefins, the crystalline branches of the\nspherulite have a **switchboard structure**, in which the chains loop\ninto and out of a plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axes of\nthe polymer (Figure (6.4)). The entry and exit into the crystalline\nregion can be adjacent or random. In the regions in between the\ncrystalline branches, the polymer is amorphous. The spherulitic\nstructure---even for the most ordered, crystalline polymers---guarantees\nthat there will be amorphous material in the polymer solid.\n\n#### Nucleation and growth\n\nUpon cooling of a polymer melt or solidification of a solid from\nsolution, spherulties grow following a common pattern. The process of\nnucleation and growth is illustrated in Figure (6.5). First, polymer\ncrystallites are seeded in a process called **nucleation**. In this\nprocess, the presence of defects or random variations in density cause\nthe association of two or more segments of nearby polymer chains (or\ndifferent segments of the same polymer chain). The favorable enthalpy of\nthis type of association causes other nearby chains to be recruited to\nthe growing spherulite. These structures, which start out spherically\nshaped, ultimately impinge upon each other. The ultimate structures are\nseldom spherical---the boundaries of the spherulites within the solid\nstructure end up resembling a blob of soap bubbles.\n\n(Figure 6.5) \n>>>image(nucleation growth.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.2. The amorphous phase\n\nThe only phase that one is guaranteed to find in a polymeric solid is\nthe amorphous phase. Amorphous material is less dense than crystalline\nmaterial, and tends to look like a 3D network of cooked spaghetti. The\namorphous phase is characterized by its $T_g$, the temperature at which\nthe activation barrier for the translation of polymer chains sliding\npast each other has been reached.[^6.1.10] Below the $T_g$, the polymer\nsample is said to be **glassy**, like cooked spaghetti that is then\nfrozen in its tangled up state. In this arrangement, mechanical energy\ntends to be dissipated by the breakage of covalent bonds, though it can\nbe made to absorb energy though one or more **sub-$T_g$ relaxation\nmechanisms**, which are basically bonds (often side chains) that can\nrotate. Such routing of mechanical energy can prevent catastrophic\nfailure. Above the $T_g$, the polymer is in a state where the molecules\nare more or less free flowing in a melt. The glass transition usually\noccurs over a small range of temperatures, and one does not get a\ndiscontinuous change in properties such as density or heat capacity.\nInstead, these quantities increase gradually.\n\nThe diagram below (Figure (6.6)) shows a useful relationship between the\nvan der Waals volume, the free volume, and the expansion volume (which\naccelerates after passing $T_g$) as a function of temperature. The van\nder Waals volume is the space taken up by the electron clouds using the\nvan der Waals radii, $r$ $_{VDW}$ , of all the atoms. The free volume is\nthe \"empty space\" between the atoms due to inefficient packing. The\nexpansion volume is the volume that is dependent on temperature, and\nincreases with increasing molecular motion. This is the thermal\nexpansion that makes an exterior door or window more difficult to open\nand close when the sun has been shining on it all day.\n\n(Figure 6.6) \n>>>image(free volume.png.0)\n\n#### Factors affecting $T_g$\n\nThe glass transition temperature is a quantity that engineers often want\nto tune. The reason is that the $T_g$ strongly determines many\nthermomechanical properties of interest, including elastic modulus,\nstrength, and toughness. The $T_g$ depends first and foremost on the\n**free volume**. The greater the free volume, the lower the integrated\nvan der Waals forces between atoms and the easier it is to put the\nchains in a state of flow. In general, a monodisperse, pure sample\n**annealed**[^6.1.11] from the melt will maximize the $T_g$. Almost any\nmodifications made to the polymer structure or by blending the polymer\nwith additives will increase the disorder, thus also the free volume,\nand thence decrease the $T_g$. So, techniques for lowering the $T_g$\ninclude\n\n1.  Introducing randomness into the molecular structure\n\n2.  Decreasing $M_n$ or $M_w$\n\n3.  Increasing the dispersity,\n\n4.  Cooling a melt quickly (thermal history)\n\n5.  Adding a small molecule plasticizer\n\n6.  Not fully removing the solvent\n\n### 6.1.3. Measurement of thermal properties\n\nThe thermal transitions in a polymer are most readily measured by a\ntechnique called **differential scanning calorimetry** (DSC). In DSC, a\npolymer sample is heated in a small metal dish alongside an empty metal\ndish. Small amounts of heat are added to the two dishes with the goal of\nmaintaining a constant temperature between the sample and the empty\ndish. During an exothermic transition (e.g., crystallization), heat is\ngenerated by the sample itself, so less heat needs to be added to the\ndish to keep the temperature the same as the empty dish. In the case of\nan endothermic transition (e.g., melting), the opposite is true. That\nis, it takes additional heat to maintain a steady increase in\ntemperature. Figure (6.7) below shows what one might observe for a\nunidirectional scan from low to high temperature of a semicrystalline\npolymer sample initially in a highly glassy state.\n\n(Figure 6.7) \n>>>image(DSC.png.0)\n\nThe heat capacity is represented by the overall slope of the line.\nNotice the increase in slope of the line in the vicinity of $T_g$, after\nwhich there is an increase in the amount of heat absorbable for a given\nincrease in temperature.\n\n[^6.1.1]: In contrast to a metallic, ionic (sodium chloride), or covalent\n    crystal (diamond or silicon), which has stronger bonds between the\n    individual atoms than does a van der Waals solid. Nevertheless, the\n    cohesive energy of a van der Waals solid can be quite large, and the\n    forces holding it together can require more than a human amount of\n    strength, even for a small sample.\n\n[^6.1.2]: Polymorphism means that the same chemical structure can have\n    different microstructures in the solid state, depending on how the\n    polymer was solidified (e.g., from the melt or from solution) or on\n    its thermal history (i.e., whether it was annealed, for how long,\n    and at what temperature.\n\n[^6.1.3]: Stereoisomers are two or more molecules that have the same atoms\n    connected to the same atoms, but with different spatial\n    orientations.\n\n[^6.1.4]: A major exception is water, for which the density increases upon\n    melting.\n\n[^6.1.5]: The heat capacity of a liquid is greater than that of a solid\n    because in a liquid, heat energy can be converted to translational\n    and rotational motion, whereas in a solid it can only be converted\n    to vibrational motion.\n\n[^6.1.6]: Isotropy is the state of having no preferred direction or\n    orientation; anisotropy refers to orientation in a particular\n    direction.\n\n[^6.1.7]: See any number of excellent videos on YouTube on pulling a\n    solidified polymer strand out of a beaker containing the reactants.\n\n[^6.1.8]: A colorful name meaning long fibers that form under solidification\n    under high shear forces.\n\n[^6.1.9]: Ordinarily, having a polarizer offset by 90 $^{\\circ}$ above and\n    below the sample would produce a black image. However, if an object\n    partially rotates light of the first polarization, then it can\n    partially pass through the polarizer of the second. This technique\n    is used often in the characterization of polymers, crystals, and\n    structured fluids such as liquid crystals, whose structural details\n    are invisible to unpolarized, conventional optical microscopy.\n\n[^6.1.10]: Often taken as the\n\n[^6.1.11]: Treated by elevating the temperature followed by a slow cooling\n    to produce a solid with minimal defects.\n",
