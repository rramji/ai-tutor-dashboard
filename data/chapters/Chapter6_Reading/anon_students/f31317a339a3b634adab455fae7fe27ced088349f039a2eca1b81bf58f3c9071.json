      "content": "#### Section 1: Introduction\nWhen solidified by evaporation of a solvent (e.g., paint) or by cooling\nfrom a molten goo, polymers---*plastics*---form a wide variety of useful\nobjects. In fact, in an indoor environment, many objects are either made\nof or coated with a polymer. These plastic objects and coatings have\nproperties which derive from their molecular structures but which are\nalso determined by how those molecular structures pack in the solid\nstate. For example, is the object mostly crystalline? Totally amorphous?\nOr somewhere in between? These details determine the thermal stability\nand mechanical response of plastic objects in profound ways, as\ndiscussed here. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/JlasquVHyZ4)\n\nIn the last chapter, we explored the synthesis of polymers, starting\nwith basic organic building blocks, and ways to characterize their\nproperties in solution. Indeed, polymers in solution are central to many\nof the most modern, high-value and technologically sophisticated\nproducts of nanoengineering. For example, lipid nanoparticles\nincorporated with polymers like poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are the basis\nof the delivery vehicles for mRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19.\nPolymers in solution also comprise **photoresists** used in\nmicroelectronics manufacturing, paint and dye formulations, anticancer\ntherapeutics that evade immune detection and target cancer cells, and\nmaterials used in hydraulic fracturing in the recovery of natural gas.\nHowever, the vast majority of polymers are used to form solids, which\nhave distinctive properties owing to their highly **entangled**\nmicrostructure. Such properties include high tensile strength relative\nto weight, mechanical toughness, heat resistance, and **thermosetting**\nand **thermoplastic** properties, which allow polymeric materials to be\nformed into complex 3D objects much more easily than can be ceramics or\nmetals. In this chapter, we explore how the molecular structure of a\npolymer influences its morphology and properties in the solid state.\n\n#### Van der Waals solids\n\nA bowl of sugar (sucrose) is made up of many fine crystals. These\ncrystals are highly ordered and have a repeating structure which\ncontinues in all directions. Such a crystal diffracts X-rays (**Bragg\ndiffraction**) from which its structure and the spacing between all its\natoms can be determined. The individual sucrose molecules are held\ntogether by van der Waals forces, including hydrogen bonds, and the\nstructure is thus known as a **van der Waals solid**.[^6.1.1] Owing to its\nunique bonding arrangement, a polymeric solid has some properties of a\ncovalent solid and some properties of a van der Waals solid. For\nexample, the monomer residues within a chain are bonded covalently,\nwhile the monomers associate with each other through space by van der\nWaals interactions.\n\n#### Polymers: A special class of van der Waals solids\n\nA polymer can be solidified in one of two ways: (1) cooling from the\nmelt or (2) precipitation of solid polymer from solution upon\nevaporation of the solvent. As a polymer solidifies, many different\ntypes of structures can form. These structures depend on the molecular\nstructure of the polymer, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of\nsolidification. In general, a polymer forms **crystalline phases** and\n**amorphous phases**, with significant polymorphism possible (see Figure\n(6.1)).[^6.1.2] Thus, different samples of the same material can have\ndifferences in density in the amorphous phases and crystal structure in\neither phase. Crystalline phases are characterized by the **melting\ntemperature**, $T_m$, while amorphous phases are characterized by the\n**glass-transition temperature**, $T_g$.\n\n(Figure 6.1) \n>>>image(phases.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.1. The crystalline phase\n\nCrystalline phases of polymers have regular repeating structures. The\npresence of crystalline phases can be determined definitively by\ndiffraction of X-ray radiation (see Chapter 14). Such a structure is\nonly possible for polymers that have a regular molecular structure; any\nrandomness tends to destroy the potential for crystallinity. An example\nof a polymer which has multiple **stereoisomers**[^6.1.3] is polypropylene,\nwhich can exist in three basic isomers: **isotactic**, **syndiotactic**,\nand **atactic** (Figure (6.2)).\n\n(Figure 6.2) \n>>>image(tacticity.png.0)\n\nOf the three stereoisomers of polypropylene, only isotactic (all methyl\ngroups oriented the same way) and syndiotactc (methyl groups alternate\norientations) can crystallize. Atactic molecules have random\norientations of the methyl groups and thus cannot pack efficiently\nenough to crystallize. In practice, only isotactic and syndiotactic\npolypropylene are usable as solid materials, which can be used in\npackaging material, textiles (especially carpeting), and consumer\nelectronic devices; atactic polypropylene is a gummy material used as\nadhesives, sealants, and as components of asphalt. However, atactic\nchains can be combined by physical mixing or copolymerization with\nisotactic or syndiotactic material to tune the mechanical properties\ntoward being softer.\n\nWhen we say that a polymeric solid is crystalline, we are typically only\never talking about 30-80% crystalline. Such a sample is technically\ntermed **semicrystalline**. The reasons that a polymeric solid cannot be\ncompletely crystalline is because the ability of adjacent molecules to\nline up, end-to-end, with each other *exactly* cannot be guaranteed;\nmoreover, it is statistically nearly impossible, even for a completely\nmonodisperse sample (= 1.00000). Any dispersity whatsoever creates\nnon-overlapping chain ends and regions of **free volume** due to\ninefficient packing, decreased density, and increased mobility of\nchains. At least locally, such a region will not be crystalline.\n\nCrystalline regions of a polymer undergo a first-order phase transition\nat a specific temperature, $T_m$. The behavior of the solid observed at\nthis temperature is exactly analogous to what is observed in metallic,\nionic, or van der Waals solids. That is, the material fairly abruptly\ngoes from a solid to a liquid, with concomitant changes in **density**\n(usually decreases[^6.1.4]) and **heat capacity** (increases[^6.1.5]).\nMacroscopically, the polymer melt will not be a free-flowing liquid.\nRather, it will be a **viscoelastic liquid**, meaning that one may still\nobserve some elastic rebound if it is poked. This **viscoelastic\nbehavior** occurs because of the timescales needed to translate polymer\nchains. It literally takes on the orders of seconds, minutes, or\nhours---i.e., \"human\" timescales---for melted polymer chains to\nreorganize themselves in response to a load.\n\nThere are many types of crystalline phases possible in a polymer sample.\nFor example, stretching or shearing a polymer during solidification or\nfrom the melt often produces highly **anisotropic**[^6.1.6] structures in\nwhich the molecules line up along the stretched axis in a crystalline\nmorphology. Such a structure is produced by the *nylon rope trick*[^6.1.7]\nand is often called a shish-kebab because of the formation of roughly\ncylindrical nodules along the stretched axis. Other highly anisotropic\nstructures, nanofibers, nanowires, dendritic crystals, and\n\"shish-kebabs,\"[^6.1.8] see Figure (6.3).\n\n(Figure 6.3) \n>>>image(crystals.png.0)\n\nThe canonical crystalline structure for most reasonably flexible polymer\nchains---i.e., most polyolefins---is the **spherulite**, as illustrated\nin Figure (6.4). A spherulite resembles a three-dimensional snowflake.\nIt is a hyperbranched structure that nucleates and then propagates in\nall directions, continually branching all the way. Despite its name, the\nspherulite is rarely spherical, simply because nearby spherulites\nimpinge on each other and limit their growth. Picture blowing soap\nbubbles using a children's bubble wand. Occassionally, some bubbles will\ncome out as a blob of bubbles, none of which are completely spherical.\nMoreover, in confined geometries like thin films, the growth of the\nspherulite in the z-axis is constrained, and thus the spherulite grows\nin two dimensions only. The presence of these structures can be easily\nidentified by optical microscopy under cross-polarization.[^6.1.9] The image\none sees is called a **Maltese cross**.\n\n(Figure 6.4) \n>>>image(spherulite.png.0)\n\nFor flexible polymers like polyolefins, the crystalline branches of the\nspherulite have a **switchboard structure**, in which the chains loop\ninto and out of a plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axes of\nthe polymer (Figure (6.4)). The entry and exit into the crystalline\nregion can be adjacent or random. In the regions in between the\ncrystalline branches, the polymer is amorphous. The spherulitic\nstructure---even for the most ordered, crystalline polymers---guarantees\nthat there will be amorphous material in the polymer solid.\n\n#### Nucleation and growth\n\nUpon cooling of a polymer melt or solidification of a solid from\nsolution, spherulties grow following a common pattern. The process of\nnucleation and growth is illustrated in Figure (6.5). First, polymer\ncrystallites are seeded in a process called **nucleation**. In this\nprocess, the presence of defects or random variations in density cause\nthe association of two or more segments of nearby polymer chains (or\ndifferent segments of the same polymer chain). The favorable enthalpy of\nthis type of association causes other nearby chains to be recruited to\nthe growing spherulite. These structures, which start out spherically\nshaped, ultimately impinge upon each other. The ultimate structures are\nseldom spherical---the boundaries of the spherulites within the solid\nstructure end up resembling a blob of soap bubbles.\n\n(Figure 6.5) \n>>>image(nucleation growth.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.2. The amorphous phase\n\nThe only phase that one is guaranteed to find in a polymeric solid is\nthe amorphous phase. Amorphous material is less dense than crystalline\nmaterial, and tends to look like a 3D network of cooked spaghetti. The\namorphous phase is characterized by its $T_g$, the temperature at which\nthe activation barrier for the translation of polymer chains sliding\npast each other has been reached.[^6.1.10] Below the $T_g$, the polymer\nsample is said to be **glassy**, like cooked spaghetti that is then\nfrozen in its tangled up state. In this arrangement, mechanical energy\ntends to be dissipated by the breakage of covalent bonds, though it can\nbe made to absorb energy though one or more **sub-$T_g$ relaxation\nmechanisms**, which are basically bonds (often side chains) that can\nrotate. Such routing of mechanical energy can prevent catastrophic\nfailure. Above the $T_g$, the polymer is in a state where the molecules\nare more or less free flowing in a melt. The glass transition usually\noccurs over a small range of temperatures, and one does not get a\ndiscontinuous change in properties such as density or heat capacity.\nInstead, these quantities increase gradually.\n\nThe diagram below (Figure (6.6)) shows a useful relationship between the\nvan der Waals volume, the free volume, and the expansion volume (which\naccelerates after passing $T_g$) as a function of temperature. The van\nder Waals volume is the space taken up by the electron clouds using the\nvan der Waals radii, $r$ $_{VDW}$ , of all the atoms. The free volume is\nthe \"empty space\" between the atoms due to inefficient packing. The\nexpansion volume is the volume that is dependent on temperature, and\nincreases with increasing molecular motion. This is the thermal\nexpansion that makes an exterior door or window more difficult to open\nand close when the sun has been shining on it all day.\n\n(Figure 6.6) \n>>>image(free volume.png.0)\n\n#### Factors affecting $T_g$\n\nThe glass transition temperature is a quantity that engineers often want\nto tune. The reason is that the $T_g$ strongly determines many\nthermomechanical properties of interest, including elastic modulus,\nstrength, and toughness. The $T_g$ depends first and foremost on the\n**free volume**. The greater the free volume, the lower the integrated\nvan der Waals forces between atoms and the easier it is to put the\nchains in a state of flow. In general, a monodisperse, pure sample\n**annealed**[^6.1.11] from the melt will maximize the $T_g$. Almost any\nmodifications made to the polymer structure or by blending the polymer\nwith additives will increase the disorder, thus also the free volume,\nand thence decrease the $T_g$. So, techniques for lowering the $T_g$\ninclude\n\n1.  Introducing randomness into the molecular structure\n\n2.  Decreasing $M_n$ or $M_w$\n\n3.  Increasing the dispersity,\n\n4.  Cooling a melt quickly (thermal history)\n\n5.  Adding a small molecule plasticizer\n\n6.  Not fully removing the solvent\n\n### 6.1.3. Measurement of thermal properties\n\nThe thermal transitions in a polymer are most readily measured by a\ntechnique called **differential scanning calorimetry** (DSC). In DSC, a\npolymer sample is heated in a small metal dish alongside an empty metal\ndish. Small amounts of heat are added to the two dishes with the goal of\nmaintaining a constant temperature between the sample and the empty\ndish. During an exothermic transition (e.g., crystallization), heat is\ngenerated by the sample itself, so less heat needs to be added to the\ndish to keep the temperature the same as the empty dish. In the case of\nan endothermic transition (e.g., melting), the opposite is true. That\nis, it takes additional heat to maintain a steady increase in\ntemperature. Figure (6.7) below shows what one might observe for a\nunidirectional scan from low to high temperature of a semicrystalline\npolymer sample initially in a highly glassy state.\n\n(Figure 6.7) \n>>>image(DSC.png.0)\n\nThe heat capacity is represented by the overall slope of the line.\nNotice the increase in slope of the line in the vicinity of $T_g$, after\nwhich there is an increase in the amount of heat absorbable for a given\nincrease in temperature.\n\n[^6.1.1]: In contrast to a metallic, ionic (sodium chloride), or covalent\n    crystal (diamond or silicon), which has stronger bonds between the\n    individual atoms than does a van der Waals solid. Nevertheless, the\n    cohesive energy of a van der Waals solid can be quite large, and the\n    forces holding it together can require more than a human amount of\n    strength, even for a small sample.\n\n[^6.1.2]: Polymorphism means that the same chemical structure can have\n    different microstructures in the solid state, depending on how the\n    polymer was solidified (e.g., from the melt or from solution) or on\n    its thermal history (i.e., whether it was annealed, for how long,\n    and at what temperature.\n\n[^6.1.3]: Stereoisomers are two or more molecules that have the same atoms\n    connected to the same atoms, but with different spatial\n    orientations.\n\n[^6.1.4]: A major exception is water, for which the density increases upon\n    melting.\n\n[^6.1.5]: The heat capacity of a liquid is greater than that of a solid\n    because in a liquid, heat energy can be converted to translational\n    and rotational motion, whereas in a solid it can only be converted\n    to vibrational motion.\n\n[^6.1.6]: Isotropy is the state of having no preferred direction or\n    orientation; anisotropy refers to orientation in a particular\n    direction.\n\n[^6.1.7]: See any number of excellent videos on YouTube on pulling a\n    solidified polymer strand out of a beaker containing the reactants.\n\n[^6.1.8]: A colorful name meaning long fibers that form under solidification\n    under high shear forces.\n\n[^6.1.9]: Ordinarily, having a polarizer offset by 90 $^{\\circ}$ above and\n    below the sample would produce a black image.

      "content": "#### Section 2: Mechanical properties of polymers\nThe mechanical properties of a polymer are ultimately determined by the\nmolecular structure, but strongly mediated by the phases present in the\nsolid at a given temperature. These phases also depend on the thermal\nhistory. For example, a semicrystalline polymer sample below $T_m$ and\n$T_g$ will be solid, glassy, and high modulus.[^6.2.1] Above $T_g$ but below\n$T_m$, the amorphous domains will be flowing and liquid-like, but the\nsolid structure will be held together by the crystalline domains, which\nare connected to one another by **tie chains** that pass through the\namorphous domains. This is sometimes called the **elastomeric regime**,\nbecause a solid material above its $T_g$ has some of the properties of a\nrubber. Above $T_m$, the sample is melted into a viscoelastic liquid.\nEventually, the elasticity goes to zero and the viscosity decreases as\nwell.\n\n### 6.2.1. Effect of $T_g$ on the mechanical properties\n\nLet's first consider what happens when a glassy amorphous material is\nheated. A plot is sketched in Figure (6.8) that shows the mechanical\nbehavior of atactic polystyrene as a function of temperature.\n\n(Figure 6.8) \n>>>image(leathery.png.0)\n\nThe material starts in a glassy state with a modulus of around 1 GPa\n(typical of polymer glasses). Around $T_g$, the polymer undergoes a\nsharp decrease in modulus through a regime called **leathery**.[^6.2.2]\nNext, it transitions to a **rubbery** regime where significant\nelasticity is retained (at least with small loads and short timescales),\nthen some of the elasticity is lost in the **rubbery flow** regime,\nfollowed by the **viscous flow** regime. It is not necessary to memorize\nthese different regimes, just the general shape of the curve, and what\nmight be happening to the molecules in the sample.\n\n### 6.2.2. Stress-strain behavior\n\nThe typical method used to measure the mechanical properties of polymers\nis called a **tensile test** or **pull test**. To do this test, one\nmounts a sample with a uniform cross section to a pull tester[^6.2.3] and\nmeasures the force as a function of displacement, i.e., the distanced\nstretched. To make sense of the data, it is necessary to divide the\nforce by the initial cross-sectional dimensions to get the **stress**,\n$\\sigma$, usually expressed in the same units as pressure. The MKS unit\nof stress is Pa (1 Pa = 1 N m$^{-2}$). The displacement is converted to\n**strain**, $\\epsilon$, specifically **engineering strain**, which is\nthe fractional increase in length from a starting length, $L_0$, see\nFigure (6.9).\n\n(Figure 6.9) \n>>>image(strain definition.png.0)\n\n#### Mechanical figures of merit\n\nLet's consider what happens when you stretch of a semicrystalline\npolymer. Not all polymers will behave exactly this way, but it is useful\nto consider what happens to a typical polymer (see Figure (6.10)). As\nthe sample is stretched, from 0 to $\\le$ 10% strain, the stress needed\nto elongate the sample increases at a constant, linear rate. This rate\nof increase is called the **tensile** or **Young's modulus**, $E$, which\nis the slope of this line. Since the strain has units of m/m, the\nmodulus, like the stress, has units of Pa. At a certain point, the\nstress is no longer proportional to strain. This occurs at the\n**proportionality limit**. As the sample is stretched a tiny bit more,\nwe reach the **elastic limit** or **yield point**. The area under the\ncurve between 0 and the proportionality limit is called the **modulus of\nresilience**, which has units of energy per unit volume. It is the\namount of energy the material can store prior to plastic flow.\nSometimes, but not always, the stress required to elongate the sample\nafter the yield point decreases until a **lower yield point** is\nreached. Upon further elongation, the polymer then undergoes a period of\n**strain hardening** due to alignment of the chains, *vide infra*.[^6.2.4]\nThe polymer is stretched until its failure point. The area under the\nentire stress-strain curve is called the **modulus of toughness**, which\nis the mechnical energy absorbable by the entire sample per unit volume\nprior to fracture.\n\n(Figure 6.10) \n>>>image(stress-strain.png.0)\n\n#### Origins of elasticity\n\nIf the above stress-strain curve was obtained for an elastomer (above\n$T_g$ and below $T_m$), then the elasticity can be accounted for by a\nphenomenon known as **entropic elasticity**. That is, the act of\nstretching tends to align polymer chains along the stretched axis. This\nrestriction in motion is unfavorable, and there is a restoring force\nback to equilibrium in order for the mobile chains of the amorphous\ndomains to occupy as many statistical microstates as possible\n(increasing the entropy). If the material is glassy ($T<T_g$), the\nelasticity arises primarily from perturbation of the molecules away from\ntheir equilibrium positions. The restoring force is the result of van\nder Waals interactions and the preferred angles and lengths of covalent\nbonds.[^6.2.5]\n\n#### Molecular origins of deformation\n\nWhy are we talking about bulk properties in a course on nanoengineering?\nThere are two reasons. The first is that the unique properties of\nstate-of-the-art nanocomposite materials---think the materials that make\nup the body of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner---are nevertheless measured\nusing classical approaches. The second is that each part of the\nstress-strain curve can be attributed to processes occurring on the\nnanoscale within the material. For example, in our discussion of the\norigin of the elasticity in the range of 0 $\\le \\epsilon \\le$ 10%, we\nfound that the rubber-like behavior was due to entropic elasticity above\n$T_g$ and because of the stiffness of covalent bonds and strength of\nshort-range intermolecular forces below $T_g$.\n\nAs the semicrystalline polymer sample whose tensile properties are\ndepicted in the figure above is stretched to its yield point, mechanical\nenergy that was stored up elastically is dissipated by pulling\ncrystallites apart. During this transition, it is possible that the\nstress needed to elongate the sample actually *decreases* until the\n**lower yield point**, after which the polymer chains realign and\nrecrystallize. It is common to observe **birefringence** in highly\nstretch-aligned polymers, which means that the absorption or scattering\nof light or X-rays is different along the stretched axis than it is\nalong the transverse (i.e., the other) axis, which undergoes\ncompression.\n\nAs the polymer chains align along the stretched axis, it is common for\nthe stress needed for further elongation to increase, sometimes\ndramatically. This strengthening mechanism occurs naturally in the\nproduction of nylon fibers, which is why it makes such good fishing\nlines and fibers for reinforced packing materials. It is also what gives\nthe polymer Mylar its strength. Mylar, which is known as biaxially\noriented poly(ethylene terephthalate) (BOPET) is stretched along both\nthe $x$ and $y$ axes and forms a strong 2D sheet.\n\nUltimately, the stretched polymer cannot absorb any more strain, and\nadditional mechanical energy is dissipated by fracture. Fracture occurs\nin one of two ways, by **scission** (breaking of covalent bonds,\ngenerally forming unpaired---radical---electrons on either side of the\nbreak) or **pullout** (chains sliding past each other to the point where\nthere is no chain left!). Scission tends to occur upon **brittle\nfracture** (common in glassy polymers), whereas pullout occurs upon\n**ductile fracture** (common in rubbery polymers).\n\n#### Entanglement\n\nA phenomenon unique to polymers owing to the long lengths of the\nindividual chains is **entanglement**. Entanglement is a type of\n**mechanical bond** which occurs because polymer chains can slide past\neach other but not through each other. Entanglement is easy to observe\nin a pot of cooked spaghetti with the water drained. Note that it's\ndifficult to pull just a few strands of spaghetti out of the pot with a\nfork; usually, a whole clump of noodles come out all at once. These\nstrands are stuck to each other by capillary and van der Waals forces,\nbut also because they are entangled with each other. The greater the\nmolecular weight of a polymer, the greater the number of entanglements\nper chain, and---in general---the greater the modulus, strength, and\nviscosity of the melt. Often, there is a change in the slope in a plot\nof the values of these properties as a function of molecular weight.\nThis discontinuity occurs at the **entanglement molecular weight**.\n\n### 6.2.3. Analogy to the deformation of metals\n\nIt is perhaps remarkable that the tensile behavior of polymers as they\ndeform is so similar to that of metals. This similarity is striking\nbecause of the fact that the internal structure of these two classes of\nmaterials---and the nanoscale mechanisms of deformation---is very\ndifferent. Imagine a polycrystalline sample of a ductile metal, like\ngold. In the initial stages of deformation, the gold undergoes elastic\ndeformation. Atoms move from their equilibrium positions, but not\npermanently. Strong metallic bonds provide the restoring force. As the\nmetal is stretched to its yield point, mechanical energy is dissipated\nby dislocations of atoms within the crystalline grains. These\ndislocations permit stretching of the metal sample by **plastic flow**.\nDislocations propagate within grains and between them. The ease of\nplastic flow depends on (1) the number of grains and (2) how many\ndislocations are already present in the grains. The reason for (1) is\nbecause there is an energetic barrier for dislocations to cross a grain\nboundary. The reason for (2) is that there is a certain number of\ndislocations that can be accommodated in a grain; adding one dislocation\nincreases the energy needed to add the next one. When a grain can no\nlonger accommodate additional dislocations or they cannot traverse the\ngrain boundaries, the metallic bonds break. Often in metallurgy,\ndislocations are introduced intentionally by folding and\nhammering---working---the metal. This is called **strain hardening** and\nit is the same mechanism responsible for the steep increase in strength\nnear the point of fracture. When metal, e.g., in a bridge, gets close to\nthis point, we say it is **fatigued**.\n\nThe modulus and strength of a metallic sample is also determined by the\nsize of the grains. A single-crystal of a metal[^6.2.6] is soft because it\nis able to accommodate a lot of dislocations and they do not need to\ntraverse any grain boundaries. A polycrystalline sample---as in a sample\nproduced by physical vapor deposition---has many grains of micron size\nand probably a lot of dislocations within these grains. Thus, a thin\nfilm of a metal is up to two orders of magnitude stiffer and stronger\nthan a single crystal. This increase in stiffness and strength with the\nreduction of grain size is called the **Hall-Petch effect**, as\ndislocations are impeded by the sheer number of grain boundaries.\nHowever, when the grains get too small ($<$ a few nanometers), *the\ngrains themselves* become mobile in the sample and the deformability of\nthe sample increases. This phenomenon is called the **inverse Hall-Petch\neffect** and is one of many nanoscale phenomena that affect the\nproperties of macroscopic materials.\n\n[^6.2.1]: The modulus is like a 3D version of the constant $k$ from Hooke's\n    law, which describes how much force is needed to deform a spring\n    along one axis.\n\n[^6.2.2]: We are not sure why it's called \"leathery.\" I guess because\n    leather is pliable but still fairly stiff upon tension.\n\n[^6.2.3]: A famous manufacturer of these pull testers is Instron; you can\n    image search this company to see what they look like.\n\n[^6.2.4]: Latin for \"See below.\\\"\n\n[^6.2.5]: As predicted to be preferred by quantum mechanics.\n\n[^6.2.6]: Expensive!!!\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Introduction\nWhen solidified by evaporation of a solvent (e.g., paint) or by cooling\nfrom a molten goo, polymers---*plastics*---form a wide variety of useful\nobjects. In fact, in an indoor environment, many objects are either made\nof or coated with a polymer. These plastic objects and coatings have\nproperties which derive from their molecular structures but which are\nalso determined by how those molecular structures pack in the solid\nstate. For example, is the object mostly crystalline? Totally amorphous?\nOr somewhere in between? These details determine the thermal stability\nand mechanical response of plastic objects in profound ways, as\ndiscussed here. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/JlasquVHyZ4)\n\nIn the last chapter, we explored the synthesis of polymers, starting\nwith basic organic building blocks, and ways to characterize their\nproperties in solution. Indeed, polymers in solution are central to many\nof the most modern, high-value and technologically sophisticated\nproducts of nanoengineering. For example, lipid nanoparticles\nincorporated with polymers like poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are the basis\nof the delivery vehicles for mRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19.\nPolymers in solution also comprise **photoresists** used in\nmicroelectronics manufacturing, paint and dye formulations, anticancer\ntherapeutics that evade immune detection and target cancer cells, and\nmaterials used in hydraulic fracturing in the recovery of natural gas.\nHowever, the vast majority of polymers are used to form solids, which\nhave distinctive properties owing to their highly **entangled**\nmicrostructure. Such properties include high tensile strength relative\nto weight, mechanical toughness, heat resistance, and **thermosetting**\nand **thermoplastic** properties, which allow polymeric materials to be\nformed into complex 3D objects much more easily than can be ceramics or\nmetals. In this chapter, we explore how the molecular structure of a\npolymer influences its morphology and properties in the solid state.\n\n#### Van der Waals solids\n\nA bowl of sugar (sucrose) is made up of many fine crystals. These\ncrystals are highly ordered and have a repeating structure which\ncontinues in all directions. Such a crystal diffracts X-rays (**Bragg\ndiffraction**) from which its structure and the spacing between all its\natoms can be determined. The individual sucrose molecules are held\ntogether by van der Waals forces, including hydrogen bonds, and the\nstructure is thus known as a **van der Waals solid**.[^6.1.1] Owing to its\nunique bonding arrangement, a polymeric solid has some properties of a\ncovalent solid and some properties of a van der Waals solid. For\nexample, the monomer residues within a chain are bonded covalently,\nwhile the monomers associate with each other through space by van der\nWaals interactions.\n\n#### Polymers: A special class of van der Waals solids\n\nA polymer can be solidified in one of two ways: (1) cooling from the\nmelt or (2) precipitation of solid polymer from solution upon\nevaporation of the solvent. As a polymer solidifies, many different\ntypes of structures can form. These structures depend on the molecular\nstructure of the polymer, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of\nsolidification. In general, a polymer forms **crystalline phases** and\n**amorphous phases**, with significant polymorphism possible (see Figure\n(6.1)).[^6.1.2] Thus, different samples of the same material can have\ndifferences in density in the amorphous phases and crystal structure in\neither phase. Crystalline phases are characterized by the **melting\ntemperature**, $T_m$, while amorphous phases are characterized by the\n**glass-transition temperature**, $T_g$.\n\n(Figure 6.1) \n>>>image(phases.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.1. The crystalline phase\n\nCrystalline phases of polymers have regular repeating structures. The\npresence of crystalline phases can be determined definitively by\ndiffraction of X-ray radiation (see Chapter 14). Such a structure is\nonly possible for polymers that have a regular molecular structure; any\nrandomness tends to destroy the potential for crystallinity. An example\nof a polymer which has multiple **stereoisomers**[^6.1.3] is polypropylene,\nwhich can exist in three basic isomers: **isotactic**, **syndiotactic**,\nand **atactic** (Figure (6.2)).\n\n(Figure 6.2) \n>>>image(tacticity.png.0)\n\nOf the three stereoisomers of polypropylene, only isotactic (all methyl\ngroups oriented the same way) and syndiotactc (methyl groups alternate\norientations) can crystallize. Atactic molecules have random\norientations of the methyl groups and thus cannot pack efficiently\nenough to crystallize. In practice, only isotactic and syndiotactic\npolypropylene are usable as solid materials, which can be used in\npackaging material, textiles (especially carpeting), and consumer\nelectronic devices; atactic polypropylene is a gummy material used as\nadhesives, sealants, and as components of asphalt. However, atactic\nchains can be combined by physical mixing or copolymerization with\nisotactic or syndiotactic material to tune the mechanical properties\ntoward being softer.\n\nWhen we say that a polymeric solid is crystalline, we are typically only\never talking about 30-80% crystalline. Such a sample is technically\ntermed **semicrystalline**. The reasons that a polymeric solid cannot be\ncompletely crystalline is because the ability of adjacent molecules to\nline up, end-to-end, with each other *exactly* cannot be guaranteed;\nmoreover, it is statistically nearly impossible, even for a completely\nmonodisperse sample (= 1.00000). Any dispersity whatsoever creates\nnon-overlapping chain ends and regions of **free volume** due to\ninefficient packing, decreased density, and increased mobility of\nchains. At least locally, such a region will not be crystalline.\n\nCrystalline regions of a polymer undergo a first-order phase transition\nat a specific temperature, $T_m$. The behavior of the solid observed at\nthis temperature is exactly analogous to what is observed in metallic,\nionic, or van der Waals solids. That is, the material fairly abruptly\ngoes from a solid to a liquid, with concomitant changes in **density**\n(usually decreases[^6.1.4]) and **heat capacity** (increases[^6.1.5]).\nMacroscopically, the polymer melt will not be a free-flowing liquid.\nRather, it will be a **viscoelastic liquid**, meaning that one may still\nobserve some elastic rebound if it is poked. This **viscoelastic\nbehavior** occurs because of the timescales needed to translate polymer\nchains. It literally takes on the orders of seconds, minutes, or\nhours---i.e., \"human\" timescales---for melted polymer chains to\nreorganize themselves in response to a load.\n\nThere are many types of crystalline phases possible in a polymer sample.\nFor example, stretching or shearing a polymer during solidification or\nfrom the melt often produces highly **anisotropic**[^6.1.6] structures in\nwhich the molecules line up along the stretched axis in a crystalline\nmorphology. Such a structure is produced by the *nylon rope trick*[^6.1.7]\nand is often called a shish-kebab because of the formation of roughly\ncylindrical nodules along the stretched axis. Other highly anisotropic\nstructures, nanofibers, nanowires, dendritic crystals, and\n\"shish-kebabs,\"[^6.1.8] see Figure (6.3).\n\n(Figure 6.3) \n>>>image(crystals.png.0)\n\nThe canonical crystalline structure for most reasonably flexible polymer\nchains---i.e., most polyolefins---is the **spherulite**, as illustrated\nin Figure (6.4). A spherulite resembles a three-dimensional snowflake.\nIt is a hyperbranched structure that nucleates and then propagates in\nall directions, continually branching all the way. Despite its name, the\nspherulite is rarely spherical, simply because nearby spherulites\nimpinge on each other and limit their growth. Picture blowing soap\nbubbles using a children's bubble wand. Occassionally, some bubbles will\ncome out as a blob of bubbles, none of which are completely spherical.\nMoreover, in confined geometries like thin films, the growth of the\nspherulite in the z-axis is constrained, and thus the spherulite grows\nin two dimensions only. The presence of these structures can be easily\nidentified by optical microscopy under cross-polarization.[^6.1.9] The image\none sees is called a **Maltese cross**.\n\n(Figure 6.4) \n>>>image(spherulite.png.0)\n\nFor flexible polymers like polyolefins, the crystalline branches of the\nspherulite have a **switchboard structure**, in which the chains loop\ninto and out of a plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axes of\nthe polymer (Figure (6.4)). The entry and exit into the crystalline\nregion can be adjacent or random. In the regions in between the\ncrystalline branches, the polymer is amorphous. The spherulitic\nstructure---even for the most ordered, crystalline polymers---guarantees\nthat there will be amorphous material in the polymer solid.\n\n#### Nucleation and growth\n\nUpon cooling of a polymer melt or solidification of a solid from\nsolution, spherulties grow following a common pattern. The process of\nnucleation and growth is illustrated in Figure (6.5). First, polymer\ncrystallites are seeded in a process called **nucleation**. In this\nprocess, the presence of defects or random variations in density cause\nthe association of two or more segments of nearby polymer chains (or\ndifferent segments of the same polymer chain). The favorable enthalpy of\nthis type of association causes other nearby chains to be recruited to\nthe growing spherulite. These structures, which start out spherically\nshaped, ultimately impinge upon each other. The ultimate structures are\nseldom spherical---the boundaries of the spherulites within the solid\nstructure end up resembling a blob of soap bubbles.\n\n(Figure 6.5) \n>>>image(nucleation growth.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.2. The amorphous phase\n\nThe only phase that one is guaranteed to find in a polymeric solid is\nthe amorphous phase. Amorphous material is less dense than crystalline\nmaterial, and tends to look like a 3D network of cooked spaghetti. The\namorphous phase is characterized by its $T_g$, the temperature at which\nthe activation barrier for the translation of polymer chains sliding\npast each other has been reached.[^6.1.10] Below the $T_g$, the polymer\nsample is said to be **glassy**, like cooked spaghetti that is then\nfrozen in its tangled up state. In this arrangement, mechanical energy\ntends to be dissipated by the breakage of covalent bonds, though it can\nbe made to absorb energy though one or more **sub-$T_g$ relaxation\nmechanisms**, which are basically bonds (often side chains) that can\nrotate. Such routing of mechanical energy can prevent catastrophic\nfailure. Above the $T_g$, the polymer is in a state where the molecules\nare more or less free flowing in a melt. The glass transition usually\noccurs over a small range of temperatures, and one does not get a\ndiscontinuous change in properties such as density or heat capacity.\nInstead, these quantities increase gradually.\n\nThe diagram below (Figure (6.6)) shows a useful relationship between the\nvan der Waals volume, the free volume, and the expansion volume (which\naccelerates after passing $T_g$) as a function of temperature. The van\nder Waals volume is the space taken up by the electron clouds using the\nvan der Waals radii, $r$ $_{VDW}$ , of all the atoms. The free volume is\nthe \"empty space\" between the atoms due to inefficient packing. The\nexpansion volume is the volume that is dependent on temperature, and\nincreases with increasing molecular motion. This is the thermal\nexpansion that makes an exterior door or window more difficult to open\nand close when the sun has been shining on it all day.\n\n(Figure 6.6) \n>>>image(free volume.png.0)\n\n#### Factors affecting $T_g$\n\nThe glass transition temperature is a quantity that engineers often want\nto tune. The reason is that the $T_g$ strongly determines many\nthermomechanical properties of interest, including elastic modulus,\nstrength, and toughness. The $T_g$ depends first and foremost on the\n**free volume**. The greater the free volume, the lower the integrated\nvan der Waals forces between atoms and the easier it is to put the\nchains in a state of flow. In general, a monodisperse, pure sample\n**annealed**[^6.1.11] from the melt will maximize the $T_g$. Almost any\nmodifications made to the polymer structure or by blending the polymer\nwith additives will increase the disorder, thus also the free volume,\nand thence decrease the $T_g$. So, techniques for lowering the $T_g$\ninclude\n\n1.  Introducing randomness into the molecular structure\n\n2.  Decreasing $M_n$ or $M_w$\n\n3.  Increasing the dispersity,\n\n4.  Cooling a melt quickly (thermal history)\n\n5.  Adding a small molecule plasticizer\n\n6.  Not fully removing the solvent\n\n### 6.1.3. Measurement of thermal properties\n\nThe thermal transitions in a polymer are most readily measured by a\ntechnique called **differential scanning calorimetry** (DSC). In DSC, a\npolymer sample is heated in a small metal dish alongside an empty metal\ndish. Small amounts of heat are added to the two dishes with the goal of\nmaintaining a constant temperature between the sample and the empty\ndish. During an exothermic transition (e.g., crystallization), heat is\ngenerated by the sample itself, so less heat needs to be added to the\ndish to keep the temperature the same as the empty dish. In the case of\nan endothermic transition (e.g., melting), the opposite is true. That\nis, it takes additional heat to maintain a steady increase in\ntemperature. Figure (6.7) below shows what one might observe for a\nunidirectional scan from low to high temperature of a semicrystalline\npolymer sample initially in a highly glassy state.\n\n(Figure 6.7) \n>>>image(DSC.png.0)\n\nThe heat capacity is represented by the overall slope of the line.\nNotice the increase in slope of the line in the vicinity of $T_g$, after\nwhich there is an increase in the amount of heat absorbable for a given\nincrease in temperature.\n\n[^6.1.1]: In contrast to a metallic, ionic (sodium chloride), or covalent\n    crystal (diamond or silicon), which has stronger bonds between the\n    individual atoms than does a van der Waals solid. Nevertheless, the\n    cohesive energy of a van der Waals solid can be quite large, and the\n    forces holding it together can require more than a human amount of\n    strength, even for a small sample.\n\n[^6.1.2]: Polymorphism means that the same chemical structure can have\n    different microstructures in the solid state, depending on how the\n    polymer was solidified (e.g., from the melt or from solution) or on\n    its thermal history (i.e., whether it was annealed, for how long,\n    and at what temperature.\n\n[^6.1.3]: Stereoisomers are two or more molecules that have the same atoms\n    connected to the same atoms, but with different spatial\n    orientations.\n\n[^6.1.4]: A major exception is water, for which the density increases upon\n    melting.\n\n[^6.1.5]: The heat capacity of a liquid is greater than that of a solid\n    because in a liquid, heat energy can be converted to translational\n    and rotational motion, whereas in a solid it can only be converted\n    to vibrational motion.\n\n[^6.1.6]: Isotropy is the state of having no preferred direction or\n    orientation; anisotropy refers to orientation in a particular\n    direction.\n\n[^6.1.7]: See any number of excellent videos on YouTube on pulling a\n    solidified polymer strand out of a beaker containing the reactants.\n\n[^6.1.8]: A colorful name meaning long fibers that form under solidification\n    under high shear forces.\n\n[^6.1.9]: Ordinarily, having a polarizer offset by 90 $^{\\circ}$ above and\n    below the sample would produce a black image. However, if an object\n    partially rotates light of the first polarization, then it can\n    partially pass through the polarizer of the second. This technique\n    is used often in the characterization of polymers, crystals, and\n    structured fluids such as liquid crystals, whose structural details\n    are invisible to unpolarized, conventional optical microscopy.\n\n[^6.1.10]: Often taken as the\n\n[^6.1.11]: Treated by elevating the temperature followed by a slow cooling\n    to produce a solid with minimal defects.\n",

In this chapter, we explore how the molecular structure of a\npolymer influences its morphology and properties in the solid state.\n\n#### Van der Waals solids\n\nA bowl of sugar (sucrose) is made up of many fine crystals. These\ncrystals are highly ordered and have a repeating structure which\ncontinues in all directions. Such a crystal diffracts X-rays (**Bragg\ndiffraction**) from which its structure and the spacing between all its\natoms can be determined. The individual sucrose molecules are held\ntogether by van der Waals forces, including hydrogen bonds, and the\nstructure is thus known as a **van der Waals solid**.[^6.1.1] Owing to its\nunique bonding arrangement, a polymeric solid has some properties of a\ncovalent solid and some properties of a van der Waals solid. For\nexample, the monomer residues within a chain are bonded covalently,\nwhile the monomers associate with each other through space by van der\nWaals interactions.\n\n#### Polymers: A special class of van der Waals solids\n\nA polymer can be solidified in one of two ways: (1) cooling from the\nmelt or (2) precipitation of solid polymer from solution upon\nevaporation of the solvent. As a polymer solidifies, many different\ntypes of structures can form. These structures depend on the molecular\nstructure of the polymer, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of\nsolidification. In general, a polymer forms **crystalline phases** and\n**amorphous phases**, with significant polymorphism possible (see Figure\n(6.1)).[^6.1.2] Thus, different samples of the same material can have\ndifferences in density in the amorphous phases and crystal structure in\neither phase. Crystalline phases are characterized by the **melting\ntemperature**, $T_m$, while amorphous phases are characterized by the\n**glass-transition temperature**, $T_g$.\n\n(Figure 6.1) \n>>>image(phases.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.1. The crystalline phase\n\nCrystalline phases of polymers have regular repeating structures. The\npresence of crystalline phases can be determined definitively by\ndiffraction of X-ray radiation (see Chapter 14). Such a structure is\nonly possible for polymers that have a regular molecular structure; any\nrandomness tends to destroy the potential for crystallinity. An example\nof a polymer which has multiple **stereoisomers**[^6.1.3] is polypropylene,\nwhich can exist in three basic isomers: **isotactic**, **syndiotactic**,\nand **atactic** (Figure (6.2)).\n\n(Figure 6.2) \n>>>image(tacticity.png.0)\n\nOf the three stereoisomers of polypropylene, only isotactic (all methyl\ngroups oriented the same way) and syndiotactc (methyl groups alternate\norientations) can crystallize. Atactic molecules have random\norientations of the methyl groups and thus cannot pack efficiently\nenough to crystallize. In practice, only isotactic and syndiotactic\npolypropylene are usable as solid materials, which can be used in\npackaging material, textiles (especially carpeting), and consumer\nelectronic devices; atactic polypropylene is a gummy material used as\nadhesives, sealants, and as components of asphalt. However, atactic\nchains can be combined by physical mixing or copolymerization with\nisotactic or syndiotactic material to tune the mechanical properties\ntoward being softer.\n\nWhen we say that a polymeric solid is crystalline, we are typically only\never talking about 30-80% crystalline. Such a sample is technically\ntermed **semicrystalline**. The reasons that a polymeric solid cannot be\ncompletely crystalline is because the ability of adjacent molecules to\nline up, end-to-end, with each other *exactly* cannot be guaranteed;\nmoreover, it is statistically nearly impossible, even for a completely\nmonodisperse sample (= 1.00000). Any dispersity whatsoever creates\nnon-overlapping chain ends and regions of **free volume** due to\ninefficient packing, decreased density, and increased mobility of\nchains. At least locally, such a region will not be crystalline.\n\nCrystalline regions of a polymer undergo a first-order phase transition\nat a specific temperature, $T_m$. The behavior of the solid observed at\nthis temperature is exactly analogous to what is observed in metallic,\nionic, or van der Waals solids. That is, the material fairly abruptly\ngoes from a solid to a liquid, with concomitant changes in **density**\n(usually decreases[^6.1.4]) and **heat capacity** (increases[^6.1.5]).\nMacroscopically, the polymer melt will not be a free-flowing liquid.\nRather, it will be a **viscoelastic liquid**, meaning that one may still\nobserve some elastic rebound if it is poked. This **viscoelastic\nbehavior** occurs because of the timescales needed to translate polymer\nchains. It literally takes on the orders of seconds, minutes, or\nhours---i.e., \"human\" timescales---for melted polymer chains to\nreorganize themselves in response to a load.\n\nThere are many types of crystalline phases possible in a polymer sample.\nFor example, stretching or shearing a polymer during solidification or\nfrom the melt often produces highly **anisotropic**[^6.1.6] structures in\nwhich the molecules line up along the stretched axis in a crystalline\nmorphology. Such a structure is produced by the *nylon rope trick*[^6.1.7]\nand is often called a shish-kebab because of the formation of roughly\ncylindrical nodules along the stretched axis. Other highly anisotropic\nstructures, nanofibers, nanowires, dendritic crystals, and\n\"shish-kebabs,\"[^6.1.8] see Figure (6.3).\n\n(Figure 6.3) \n>>>image(crystals.png.0)\n\nThe canonical crystalline structure for most reasonably flexible polymer\nchains---i.e., most polyolefins---is the **spherulite**, as illustrated\nin Figure (6.4). A spherulite resembles a three-dimensional snowflake.\nIt is a hyperbranched structure that nucleates and then propagates in\nall directions, continually branching all the way. Despite its name, the\nspherulite is rarely spherical, simply because nearby spherulites\nimpinge on each other and limit their growth. Picture blowing soap\nbubbles using a children's bubble wand. Occassionally, some bubbles will\ncome out as a blob of bubbles, none of which are completely spherical.\nMoreover, in confined geometries like thin films, the growth of the\nspherulite in the z-axis is constrained, and thus the spherulite grows\nin two dimensions only. The presence of these structures can be easily\nidentified by optical microscopy under cross-polarization.[^6.1.9] The image\none sees is called a **Maltese cross**.\n\n(Figure 6.4) \n>>>image(spherulite.png.0)\n\nFor flexible polymers like polyolefins, the crystalline branches of the\nspherulite have a **switchboard structure**, in which the chains loop\ninto and out of a plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axes of\nthe polymer (Figure (6.4)). The entry and exit into the crystalline\nregion can be adjacent or random. In the regions in between the\ncrystalline branches, the polymer is amorphous. The spherulitic\nstructure---even for the most ordered, crystalline polymers---guarantees\nthat there will be amorphous material in the polymer solid.\n\n#### Nucleation and growth\n\nUpon cooling of a polymer melt or solidification of a solid from\nsolution, spherulties grow following a common pattern. The process of\nnucleation and growth is illustrated in Figure (6.5). First, polymer\ncrystallites are seeded in a process called **nucleation**. In this\nprocess, the presence of defects or random variations in density cause\nthe association of two or more segments of nearby polymer chains (or\ndifferent segments of the same polymer chain). The favorable enthalpy of\nthis type of association causes other nearby chains to be recruited to\nthe growing spherulite. These structures, which start out spherically\nshaped, ultimately impinge upon each other. The ultimate structures are\nseldom spherical---the boundaries of the spherulites within the solid\nstructure end up resembling a blob of soap bubbles.\n\n(Figure 6.5) \n>>>image(nucleation growth.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.2. The amorphous phase\n\nThe only phase that one is guaranteed to find in a polymeric solid is\nthe amorphous phase. Amorphous material is less dense than crystalline\nmaterial, and tends to look like a 3D network of cooked spaghetti. The\namorphous phase is characterized by its $T_g$, the temperature at which\nthe activation barrier for the translation of polymer chains sliding\npast each other has been reached.[^6.1.10] Below the $T_g$, the polymer\nsample is said to be **glassy**, like cooked spaghetti that is then\nfrozen in its tangled up state. In this arrangement, mechanical energy\ntends to be dissipated by the breakage of covalent bonds, though it can\nbe made to absorb energy though one or more **sub-$T_g$ relaxation\nmechanisms**, which are basically bonds (often side chains) that can\nrotate. Such routing of mechanical energy can prevent catastrophic\nfailure. Above the $T_g$, the polymer is in a state where the molecules\nare more or less free flowing in a melt. The glass transition usually\noccurs over a small range of temperatures, and one does not get a\ndiscontinuous change in properties such as density or heat capacity.\nInstead, these quantities increase gradually.\n\nThe diagram below (Figure (6.6)) shows a useful relationship between the\nvan der Waals volume, the free volume, and the expansion volume (which\naccelerates after passing $T_g$) as a function of temperature. The van\nder Waals volume is the space taken up by the electron clouds using the\nvan der Waals radii, $r$ $_{VDW}$ , of all the atoms. The free volume is\nthe \"empty space\" between the atoms due to inefficient packing. The\nexpansion volume is the volume that is dependent on temperature, and\nincreases with increasing molecular motion. This is the thermal\nexpansion that makes an exterior door or window more difficult to open\nand close when the sun has been shining on it all day.\n\n(Figure 6.6) \n>>>image(free volume.png.0)\n\n#### Factors affecting $T_g$\n\nThe glass transition temperature is a quantity that engineers often want\nto tune. The reason is that the $T_g$ strongly determines many\nthermomechanical properties of interest, including elastic modulus,\nstrength, and toughness. The $T_g$ depends first and foremost on the\n**free volume**. The greater the free volume, the lower the integrated\nvan der Waals forces between atoms and the easier it is to put the\nchains in a state of flow. In general, a monodisperse, pure sample\n**annealed**[^6.1.11] from the melt will maximize the $T_g$. Almost any\nmodifications made to the polymer structure or by blending the polymer\nwith additives will increase the disorder, thus also the free volume,\nand thence decrease the $T_g$. So, techniques for lowering the $T_g$\ninclude\n\n1.  Introducing randomness into the molecular structure\n\n2.  Decreasing $M_n$ or $M_w$\n\n3.  Increasing the dispersity,\n\n4.  Cooling a melt quickly (thermal history)\n\n5.  Adding a small molecule plasticizer\n\n6.  Not fully removing the solvent\n\n### 6.1.3. Measurement of thermal properties\n\nThe thermal transitions in a polymer are most readily measured by a\ntechnique called **differential scanning calorimetry** (DSC). In DSC, a\npolymer sample is heated in a small metal dish alongside an empty metal\ndish. Small amounts of heat are added to the two dishes with the goal of\nmaintaining a constant temperature between the sample and the empty\ndish. During an exothermic transition (e.g., crystallization), heat is\ngenerated by the sample itself, so less heat needs to be added to the\ndish to keep the temperature the same as the empty dish. In the case of\nan endothermic transition (e.g., melting), the opposite is true. That\nis, it takes additional heat to maintain a steady increase in\ntemperature. Figure (6.7) below shows what one might observe for a\nunidirectional scan from low to high temperature of a semicrystalline\npolymer sample initially in a highly glassy state.\n\n(Figure 6.7) \n>>>image(DSC.png.0)\n\nThe heat capacity is represented by the overall slope of the line.\nNotice the increase in slope of the line in the vicinity of $T_g$, after\nwhich there is an increase in the amount of heat absorbable for a given\nincrease in temperature.\n\n[^6.1.1]: In contrast to a metallic, ionic (sodium chloride), or covalent\n    crystal (diamond or silicon), which has stronger bonds between the\n    individual atoms than does a van der Waals solid. Nevertheless, the\n    cohesive energy of a van der Waals solid can be quite large, and the\n    forces holding it together can require more than a human amount of\n    strength, even for a small sample.\n\n[^6.1.2]: Polymorphism means that the same chemical structure can have\n    different microstructures in the solid state, depending on how the\n    polymer was solidified (e.g., from the melt or from solution) or on\n    its thermal history (i.e., whether it was annealed, for how long,\n    and at what temperature.\n\n[^6.1.3]: Stereoisomers are two or more molecules that have the same atoms\n    connected to the same atoms, but with different spatial\n    orientations.\n\n[^6.1.4]: A major exception is water, for which the density increases upon\n    melting.\n\n[^6.1.5]: The heat capacity of a liquid is greater than that of a solid\n    because in a liquid, heat energy can be converted to translational\n    and rotational motion, whereas in a solid it can only be converted\n    to vibrational motion.\n\n[^6.1.6]: Isotropy is the state of having no preferred direction or\n    orientation; anisotropy refers to orientation in a particular\n    direction.\n\n[^6.1.7]: See any number of excellent videos on YouTube on pulling a\n    solidified polymer strand out of a beaker containing the reactants.\n\n[^6.1.8]: A colorful name meaning long fibers that form under solidification\n    under high shear forces.\n\n[^6.1.9]: Ordinarily, having a polarizer offset by 90 $^{\\circ}$ above and\n    below the sample would produce a black image. However, if an object\n    partially rotates light of the first polarization, then it can\n    partially pass through the polarizer of the second. This technique\n    is used often in the characterization of polymers, crystals, and\n    structured fluids such as liquid crystals, whose structural details\n    are invisible to unpolarized, conventional optical microscopy.\n\n[^6.1.10]: Often taken as the\n\n[^6.1.11]: Treated by elevating the temperature followed by a slow cooling\n    to produce a solid with minimal defects.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Introduction\nWhen solidified by evaporation of a solvent (e.g., paint) or by cooling\nfrom a molten goo, polymers---*plastics*---form a wide variety of useful\nobjects. In fact, in an indoor environment, many objects are either made\nof or coated with a polymer. These plastic objects and coatings have\nproperties which derive from their molecular structures but which are\nalso determined by how those molecular structures pack in the solid\nstate. For example, is the object mostly crystalline? Totally amorphous?\nOr somewhere in between? These details determine the thermal stability\nand mechanical response of plastic objects in profound ways, as\ndiscussed here. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/JlasquVHyZ4)\n\nIn the last chapter, we explored the synthesis of polymers, starting\nwith basic organic building blocks, and ways to characterize their\nproperties in solution. Indeed, polymers in solution are central to many\nof the most modern, high-value and technologically sophisticated\nproducts of nanoengineering. For example, lipid nanoparticles\nincorporated with polymers like poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are the basis\nof the delivery vehicles for mRNA-based vaccines against COVID-19.\nPolymers in solution also comprise **photoresists** used in\nmicroelectronics manufacturing, paint and dye formulations, anticancer\ntherapeutics that evade immune detection and target cancer cells, and\nmaterials used in hydraulic fracturing in the recovery of natural gas.\nHowever, the vast majority of polymers are used to form solids, which\nhave distinctive properties owing to their highly **entangled**\nmicrostructure. Such properties include high tensile strength relative\nto weight, mechanical toughness, heat resistance, and **thermosetting**\nand **thermoplastic** properties, which allow polymeric materials to be\nformed into complex 3D objects much more easily than can be ceramics or\nmetals. In this chapter, we explore how the molecular structure of a\npolymer influences its morphology and properties in the solid state.\n\n#### Van der Waals solids\n\nA bowl of sugar (sucrose) is made up of many fine crystals. These\ncrystals are highly ordered and have a repeating structure which\ncontinues in all directions. Such a crystal diffracts X-rays (**Bragg\ndiffraction**) from which its structure and the spacing between all its\natoms can be determined. The individual sucrose molecules are held\ntogether by van der Waals forces, including hydrogen bonds, and the\nstructure is thus known as a **van der Waals solid**.[^6.1.1] Owing to its\nunique bonding arrangement, a polymeric solid has some properties of a\ncovalent solid and some properties of a van der Waals solid. For\nexample, the monomer residues within a chain are bonded covalently,\nwhile the monomers associate with each other through space by van der\nWaals interactions.\n\n#### Polymers: A special class of van der Waals solids\n\nA polymer can be solidified in one of two ways: (1) cooling from the\nmelt or (2) precipitation of solid polymer from solution upon\nevaporation of the solvent. As a polymer solidifies, many different\ntypes of structures can form. These structures depend on the molecular\nstructure of the polymer, and the thermodynamics and kinetics of\nsolidification. In general, a polymer forms **crystalline phases** and\n**amorphous phases**, with significant polymorphism possible (see Figure\n(6.1)).[^6.1.2] Thus, different samples of the same material can have\ndifferences in density in the amorphous phases and crystal structure in\neither phase. Crystalline phases are characterized by the **melting\ntemperature**, $T_m$, while amorphous phases are characterized by the\n**glass-transition temperature**, $T_g$.\n\n(Figure 6.1) \n>>>image(phases.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.1. The crystalline phase\n\nCrystalline phases of polymers have regular repeating structures. The\npresence of crystalline phases can be determined definitively by\ndiffraction of X-ray radiation (see Chapter 14). Such a structure is\nonly possible for polymers that have a regular molecular structure; any\nrandomness tends to destroy the potential for crystallinity. An example\nof a polymer which has multiple **stereoisomers**[^6.1.3] is polypropylene,\nwhich can exist in three basic isomers: **isotactic**, **syndiotactic**,\nand **atactic** (Figure (6.2)).\n\n(Figure 6.2) \n>>>image(tacticity.png.0)\n\nOf the three stereoisomers of polypropylene, only isotactic (all methyl\ngroups oriented the same way) and syndiotactc (methyl groups alternate\norientations) can crystallize. Atactic molecules have random\norientations of the methyl groups and thus cannot pack efficiently\nenough to crystallize. In practice, only isotactic and syndiotactic\npolypropylene are usable as solid materials, which can be used in\npackaging material, textiles (especially carpeting), and consumer\nelectronic devices; atactic polypropylene is a gummy material used as\nadhesives, sealants, and as components of asphalt. However, atactic\nchains can be combined by physical mixing or copolymerization with\nisotactic or syndiotactic material to tune the mechanical properties\ntoward being softer.\n\nWhen we say that a polymeric solid is crystalline, we are typically only\never talking about 30-80% crystalline. Such a sample is technically\ntermed **semicrystalline**. The reasons that a polymeric solid cannot be\ncompletely crystalline is because the ability of adjacent molecules to\nline up, end-to-end, with each other *exactly* cannot be guaranteed;\nmoreover, it is statistically nearly impossible, even for a completely\nmonodisperse sample (= 1.00000). Any dispersity whatsoever creates\nnon-overlapping chain ends and regions of **free volume** due to\ninefficient packing, decreased density, and increased mobility of\nchains. At least locally, such a region will not be crystalline.\n\nCrystalline regions of a polymer undergo a first-order phase transition\nat a specific temperature, $T_m$. The behavior of the solid observed at\nthis temperature is exactly analogous to what is observed in metallic,\nionic, or van der Waals solids. That is, the material fairly abruptly\ngoes from a solid to a liquid, with concomitant changes in **density**\n(usually decreases[^6.1.4]) and **heat capacity** (increases[^6.1.5]).\nMacroscopically, the polymer melt will not be a free-flowing liquid.\nRather, it will be a **viscoelastic liquid**, meaning that one may still\nobserve some elastic rebound if it is poked. This **viscoelastic\nbehavior** occurs because of the timescales needed to translate polymer\nchains. It literally takes on the orders of seconds, minutes, or\nhours---i.e., \"human\" timescales---for melted polymer chains to\nreorganize themselves in response to a load.\n\nThere are many types of crystalline phases possible in a polymer sample.\nFor example, stretching or shearing a polymer during solidification or\nfrom the melt often produces highly **anisotropic**[^6.1.6] structures in\nwhich the molecules line up along the stretched axis in a crystalline\nmorphology. Such a structure is produced by the *nylon rope trick*[^6.1.7]\nand is often called a shish-kebab because of the formation of roughly\ncylindrical nodules along the stretched axis. Other highly anisotropic\nstructures, nanofibers, nanowires, dendritic crystals, and\n\"shish-kebabs,\"[^6.1.8] see Figure (6.3).\n\n(Figure 6.3) \n>>>image(crystals.png.0)\n\nThe canonical crystalline structure for most reasonably flexible polymer\nchains---i.e., most polyolefins---is the **spherulite**, as illustrated\nin Figure (6.4). A spherulite resembles a three-dimensional snowflake.\nIt is a hyperbranched structure that nucleates and then propagates in\nall directions, continually branching all the way. Despite its name, the\nspherulite is rarely spherical, simply because nearby spherulites\nimpinge on each other and limit their growth. Picture blowing soap\nbubbles using a children's bubble wand. Occassionally, some bubbles will\ncome out as a blob of bubbles, none of which are completely spherical.\nMoreover, in confined geometries like thin films, the growth of the\nspherulite in the z-axis is constrained, and thus the spherulite grows\nin two dimensions only. The presence of these structures can be easily\nidentified by optical microscopy under cross-polarization.[^6.1.9] The image\none sees is called a **Maltese cross**.\n\n(Figure 6.4) \n>>>image(spherulite.png.0)\n\nFor flexible polymers like polyolefins, the crystalline branches of the\nspherulite have a **switchboard structure**, in which the chains loop\ninto and out of a plane which is perpendicular to the molecular axes of\nthe polymer (Figure (6.4)). The entry and exit into the crystalline\nregion can be adjacent or random. In the regions in between the\ncrystalline branches, the polymer is amorphous. The spherulitic\nstructure---even for the most ordered, crystalline polymers---guarantees\nthat there will be amorphous material in the polymer solid.\n\n#### Nucleation and growth\n\nUpon cooling of a polymer melt or solidification of a solid from\nsolution, spherulties grow following a common pattern. The process of\nnucleation and growth is illustrated in Figure (6.5). First, polymer\ncrystallites are seeded in a process called **nucleation**. In this\nprocess, the presence of defects or random variations in density cause\nthe association of two or more segments of nearby polymer chains (or\ndifferent segments of the same polymer chain). The favorable enthalpy of\nthis type of association causes other nearby chains to be recruited to\nthe growing spherulite. These structures, which start out spherically\nshaped, ultimately impinge upon each other. The ultimate structures are\nseldom spherical---the boundaries of the spherulites within the solid\nstructure end up resembling a blob of soap bubbles.\n\n(Figure 6.5) \n>>>image(nucleation growth.png.0)\n\n### 6.1.2. The amorphous phase\n\nThe only phase that one is guaranteed to find in a polymeric solid is\nthe amorphous phase. Amorphous material is less dense than crystalline\nmaterial, and tends to look like a 3D network of cooked spaghetti. The\namorphous phase is characterized by its $T_g$, the temperature at which\nthe activation barrier for the translation of polymer chains sliding\npast each other has been reached.[^6.1.10] Below the $T_g$, the polymer\nsample is said to be **glassy**, like cooked spaghetti that is then\nfrozen in its tangled up state. In this arrangement, mechanical energy\ntends to be dissipated by the breakage of covalent bonds, though it can\nbe made to absorb energy though one or more **sub-$T_g$ relaxation\nmechanisms**, which are basically bonds (often side chains) that can\nrotate. Such routing of mechanical energy can prevent catastrophic\nfailure. Above the $T_g$, the polymer is in a state where the molecules\nare more or less free flowing in a melt. The glass transition usually\noccurs over a small range of temperatures, and one does not get a\ndiscontinuous change in properties such as density or heat capacity.\nInstead, these quantities increase gradually.\n\nThe diagram below (Figure (6.6)) shows a useful relationship between the\nvan der Waals volume, the free volume, and the expansion volume (which\naccelerates after passing $T_g$) as a function of temperature. The van\nder Waals volume is the space taken up by the electron clouds using the\nvan der Waals radii, $r$ $_{VDW}$ , of all the atoms. The free volume is\nthe \"empty space\" between the atoms due to inefficient packing. The\nexpansion volume is the volume that is dependent on temperature, and\nincreases with increasing molecular motion. This is the thermal\nexpansion that makes an exterior door or window more difficult to open\nand close when the sun has been shining on it all day.\n\n(Figure 6.6) \n>>>image(free volume.png.0)\n\n#### Factors affecting $T_g$\n\nThe glass transition temperature is a quantity that engineers often want\nto tune. The reason is that the $T_g$ strongly determines many\nthermomechanical properties of interest, including elastic modulus,\nstrength, and toughness. The $T_g$ depends first and foremost on the\n**free volume**. The greater the free volume, the lower the integrated\nvan der Waals forces between atoms and the easier it is to put the\nchains in a state of flow. In general, a monodisperse, pure sample\n**annealed**[^6.1.11] from the melt will maximize the $T_g$. Almost any\nmodifications made to the polymer structure or by blending the polymer\nwith additives will increase the disorder, thus also the free volume,\nand thence decrease the $T_g$. So, techniques for lowering the $T_g$\ninclude\n\n1.  Introducing randomness into the molecular structure\n\n2.  Decreasing $M_n$ or $M_w$\n\n3.  Increasing the dispersity,\n\n4.  Cooling a melt quickly (thermal history)\n\n5.  Adding a small molecule plasticizer\n\n6.  Not fully removing the solvent\n\n### 6.1.3. Measurement of thermal properties\n\nThe thermal transitions in a polymer are most readily measured by a\ntechnique called **differential scanning calorimetry** (DSC). In DSC, a\npolymer sample is heated in a small metal dish alongside an empty metal\ndish. Small amounts of heat are added to the two dishes with the goal of\nmaintaining a constant temperature between the sample and the empty\ndish. During an exothermic transition (e.g., crystallization), heat is\ngenerated by the sample itself, so less heat needs to be added to the\ndish to keep the temperature the same as the empty dish. In the case of\nan endothermic transition (e.g., melting), the opposite is true. That\nis, it takes additional heat to maintain a steady increase in\ntemperature. Figure (6.7) below shows what one might observe for a\nunidirectional scan from low to high temperature of a semicrystalline\npolymer sample initially in a highly glassy state.\n\n(Figure 6.7) \n>>>image(DSC.png.0)\n\nThe heat capacity is represented by the overall slope of the line.\nNotice the increase in slope of the line in the vicinity of $T_g$, after\nwhich there is an increase in the amount of heat absorbable for a given\nincrease in temperature.\n\n[^6.1.1]: In contrast to a metallic, ionic (sodium chloride), or covalent\n    crystal (diamond or silicon), which has stronger bonds between the\n    individual atoms than does a van der Waals solid. Nevertheless, the\n    cohesive energy of a van der Waals solid can be quite large, and the\n    forces holding it together can require more than a human amount of\n    strength, even for a small sample.\n\n[^6.1.2]: Polymorphism means that the same chemical structure can have\n    different microstructures in the solid state, depending on how the\n    polymer was solidified (e.g., from the melt or from solution) or on\n    its thermal history (i.e., whether it was annealed, for how long,\n    and at what temperature.\n\n[^6.1.3]: Stereoisomers are two or more molecules that have the same atoms\n    connected to the same atoms, but with different spatial\n    orientations.\n\n[^6.1.4]: A major exception is water, for which the density increases upon\n    melting.\n\n[^6.1.5]: The heat capacity of a liquid is greater than that of a solid\n    because in a liquid, heat energy can be converted to translational\n    and rotational motion, whereas in a solid it can only be converted\n    to vibrational motion.\n\n[^6.1.6]: Isotropy is the state of having no preferred direction or\n    orientation; anisotropy refers to orientation in a particular\n    direction.\n\n[^6.1.7]: See any number of excellent videos on YouTube on pulling a\n    solidified polymer strand out of a beaker containing the reactants.\n\n[^6.1.8]: A colorful name meaning long fibers that form under solidification\n    under high shear forces.\n\n[^6.1.9]: Ordinarily, having a polarizer offset by 90 $^{\\circ}$ above and\n    below the sample would produce a black image. However, if an object\n    partially rotates light of the first polarization, then it can\n    partially pass through the polarizer of the second. This technique\n    is used often in the characterization of polymers, crystals, and\n    structured fluids such as liquid crystals, whose structural details\n    are invisible to unpolarized, conventional optical microscopy.\n\n[^6.1.10]: Often taken as the\n\n[^6.1.11]: Treated by elevating the temperature followed by a slow cooling\n    to produce a solid with minimal defects.\n",
