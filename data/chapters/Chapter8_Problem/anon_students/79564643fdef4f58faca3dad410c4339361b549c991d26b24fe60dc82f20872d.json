In this case, we're evaporating metal atoms.\n\n2. \"Line-of-sight\" deposition means these metal atoms travel in straight lines from the source to the target.\n\nNow, why do you think a low base pressure might be important for this process?",

      "content": "You're on the right track! A low base pressure does indeed reduce interference. Let's expand on that:\n\n1. Low pressure means fewer gas molecules in the chamber.\n\n2. Fewer molecules result in less collision with metal atoms.\n\n3. This allows metal atoms to travel straight to the target.\n\nDoes this help explain why low pressure is important for line-of-sight deposition?",
