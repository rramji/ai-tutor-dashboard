You have discovered a type of nanocrystal\\n    whose behavior can be approximated by considering it as a\\n    one-dimensional particle in a box (that is, ignoring all\\n    considerations e.g., Coulombic attraction between the electron and\\n    hole, the mass of the hole, etc.). The tumor you are targeting is\\n    found at a depth such that all radiation with frequencies less than\\n    400 THz is absorbed by the skin and other tissues, while your\\n    imaging instrument cannot detect radiation with frequencies greater\\n    than 500 THz. Calculate the range of sizes (lengths, L) needed for\\n    your semiconductor nanocrystals if the bandgap lies between the\\n    ground state and first excited state.\\n'}",
