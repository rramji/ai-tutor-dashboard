These light waves engage\nthe matter in various ways, and some of them are conveyed back to you to\ncreate an image on your retina. The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter.

Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector!

Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat.

The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",
