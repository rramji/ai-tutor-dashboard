Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Scattering, absorption, and nothing\nWhen a photon strikes an object, three things can happen:\n**scattering**, **absorption**, and **nothing**. Which of these\neventualities occurs depends on the size, shape, atomic composition, and\nvarious idiosyncracies of the chunk of matter under consideration.\n\n### 8.2.1. Scattering\n\nScattering is the process of absorption and re-emission of a photon in\nrapid succession. In fact, most of the photons that arrive at our\nretinas have been scattered by the objects we perceive in our visual\nfield. Absorption and re-emission occurs by transient[^8.2.1] polarization\nof the electron cloud of the atoms that make up an object; when the\nelectron cloud returns to its unpolarized equilibrium, a photon is\nre-emitted. This re-emitted photon is known as the **scattered photon**.\n\n#### Elastic and inelastic scattering\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is either greater than, less than, or\nequal to the energy of the incident photon. In the case where the\nscattered photon has the same energy as that of the incident photon, the\nscattering process is deemed **elastic** or **Rayleigh** scattering.\nThat is, energy was neither absorbed by the material nor transferred to\nthe photon as a result of the collision. When the energy is greater than\nor less than that of the incident photon, the process is said to be\n**inelastic** or **Raman** scattering. That is, energy is either\nabsorbed by the material or transferred from the material to the photon.\nA schematic diagram of the two scattering processes is shown in Figure\n(8.2).\n\n(Figure 8.2) \n>>>image(scattering.png.0)\n\nInelastic scattering---the type of scattering where energy is absorbed\nby the material as a result of the collision---is by far the more common\ntype. In this case, the energy of the scattered photon is less than the\nenergy of the incident photon (longer wavelength). The \"missing\" energy\nfrom the incident photon often goes into raising the vibrational energy\nof the scatterer. That is, energy gets transferred from the incident\nphoton to the scatterer, which is initially in a low-energy vibrational\nstate. The scatterer absorbs some of this energy, knocking it up to a\nhigher energy vibrational state (i.e., vibrating at a higher frequency).\nThe downward shift in the energy of the scattered photon with respect to\nthat of the incident photon is called a **Stokes shift**, which just\nmeans that the scattered photon has less energy than the incident\nphoton. You may also see the word **red shift** or the super jargony\nword ***bathochromic* shift**.\n\n#### Vibrational spectroscopy: Infrared and Raman\n\nSometimes, a scatterer is already in a higher (excited) vibrational\nstate, and in the process of collision with the incoming photon, this\nextra energy is transferred to the scattered photon. The scattered\nphoton thus has increased energy (shorter wavelength) compared to the\nenergy of the incident photon. The shift in wavelength of the scattered\nphoton relative to the incident photon is called an **anti-Stokes**\nshift, a **blue shift**, or a ***hypsochromic* shift**. Vibrational\ntransitions, which are are usually in the infrared region of the EM\nspectrum, can be observed directly by infrared absorption\nspectroscopy[^8.2.2] or indirectly upon irradiation with a laser of a\nvisible wavelength, by **Raman spectroscopy**. In this modality, the\nenergy of the vibrational transition is equal to the difference in\nenergy between the incident and scattered light.[^8.2.3]\n\nThe differences in energy between incident and scattered or emitted\nphotons is the basis of the field of **spectroscopy**. It is often\npossible to reveal something about the construction of molecules and the\ncomposition of matter by analyzing the *spectra* produced by\nlight-matter interactions. These spectra can act as fingerprints unique\nto the interaction taking place, and like detectives at the scene of a\ncrime, we can use spectroscopy help identify the matter of interest. We\nwill touch on electronic absorption (ultraviolet-visible) and\nfluorescence spectroscopy in later sections in this chapter.\n\n### 8.2.2. Absorption due to the movement of electrons\n\nAs we hinted in the discussion of scattering, it is common for some or\nall of the energy of an incident photon to be absorbed by the material\nor molecule. We touched on changes in vibrational energy levels that can\noccur upon absorption, but such differences usually take place in the\ninfrared spectrum. For optoelectronic applications (e.g., solar cells\nand display panels), we are often more interested in those that occur in\nthe visible range of the EM spectrum. The molecular basis for visible\nabsorption usually involves promotion of electrons from the **conduction\nband** or **bonding orbitals** to the **valence band** or **antibonding\norbitals**. These transitions are interesting because they can indicate\nchemical activity such as bond breakage or photon-driven charge\nseparation in solar cells. In Figure (8.3), we see a diagram of the band\nenergies for a generic material that absorbs light in the visible region\nof the EM spectrum (i.e., a dye molecule, a semiconductor, or a quantum\ndot).\n\n(Figure 8.3) \n>>>image(orbitals.png.0)\n\nYou might ask why, if the band gap energy has a specific value (say, 2.5\nelectron volts), the absorption spectrum is a broad hump and not a sharp\nvertical line. Indeed, for a completely isolated, single molecule at a\ntemperature of absolute zero, one might obtain a single vertical line.\nThe reason this does not happen in the real world is that the gap\nbetween the valence and conduction bands is a measure of the gap between\nthe **frontiers** or **edges** of these bands. When a molecule is in\nsolution and in van der Waals contact with nearby molecules, the energy\nlevels become blurry. That is, there are many energy states above and\nbelow these levels to and from which electrons can be excited by an\nincoming photon. The function that describes the distribution of energy\nlevels is called the **density of states**. It is this interplay of\nlight and electronic energy levels---combined with the phenomena in\nscattering---that gives rise to the perception of color.\n\n### 8.2.3. Emission: Fluorescence and Phosphorescence\n\nSuppose a molecule absorbs a photon, and an electron that was initially\nin the ground state (say at the valence band edge) gets promoted to a\nhigher energy level (say the conduction band edge). The potential energy\nof the electron is now substantially greater than it was before, and\nthis is an unstable situation. The electron will tend to return to its\nground state, and can do so in a number of ways. For example, it can\ncollide with some other molecules, which take on some of the energy as\ntranslational motion, and the electron eventually makes its way back to\nthe valence band. This process is called **non-radiative\nrecombination**[^8.2.4]. Alternatively, the electron can transfer its energy\nto another molecule, whose electron gets promoted, while the electron of\nthe original molecule returns to its ground state. This type of energy\ntransfer can be mediated by a photon---i.e., emitted by the first\nmolecule and absorbed by the second---or it can occur through space,\nwithout the emission of a photon. When the non-photon process occurs, it\nis called **F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)**, and tends to\noccur when the emission spectrum of the first molecule overlaps with the\nabsorption spectrum of the second. Finally, the excited electron may\ndecay to the ground state by emitting a photon similar, but not usually\nidentical,[^8.2.5] to the band gap in two related processes known as\n*fluorescence* and *phosphorescence*.\n\n#### Photoluminescence I: Fluorescence\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with a black light (i.e., near-visible,\nUV-A light) or pointed one at various objects to see if anything glows,\nthat glowing is a type of **photoluminescence**[^8.2.6] called\n**fluorescence**. In general, fluorescence occurs when high-energy light\nis absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule or material as lower-energy\nlight. To see why this is, consider Figure (8.4) shown below.\n\n(Figure 8.4) \n>>>image(thermalization.png.0)\n\nThe band gap has a specific energy and it is true that photons with\nenergies *below* the band gap do not get absorbed. However, we know that\nphotons with energies *above* than the band gap get absorbed all the\ntime. When an electron gets excited by such a high-energy photon, where\ndoes it go? The answer is that it gets promoted to one of the energy\nlevels above the band edge with a probability based on the **density of\nstates**.[^8.2.7] Once the electron is in this higher-energy state, it\nquickly transitions down to the band edge by releasing its energy into\nthe bulk material (or solution) as heat. This process, known as\n**thermalization**, ensures that the starting point for every\nfluorescent process starts with the electron at the bottom of the\nconduction band. While these electrons may return to the energy level\nexactly at the edge of the valence band, it is more likely that they too\nwill find a band with a lower energy than the band edge. Again, this\nprocess is determined by the density of states, this time below the band\nedge. These processes ensure that the energy of the absorption spectrum\nfor a molecule or material is centered in a range higher than that of\nthe fluorescence spectrum.\n\n#### Photoluminescence II: Phosphorescence\n\nThe day I wrote this sentence, I helped my three-year-old daughter put\nconstellations of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of her bedroom.\nAt first, the glow emitted by glow-in-the-dark stickers, plastic, and\npaint seems like it might be fluorescent. However, fluorescent items\nstop glowing as soon as we turn off the excitation sources, whereas\nglow-in-the-dark materials stay lit for several minutes or even hours.\nThis long-lasting glow is indicative of a process known as\n**phosphorescence**. Phosphorescence occurs when the **spin** of an\nexcited electron changes sign (i.e., from \"up\" to \"down\" or vice versa).\nSuch an electron enters a new manifold of energy states in a process\ncalled **intersystem crossing**. From this new manifold of energy\nstates, the spin of the electron must go back to its original spin in\norder to transition back down to its original ground state. This\ntransition is quantum mechanically \"forbidden.\" It still happens, but\nwith a lower probability and thus it takes a long time. Hence why the\nstars glow long after the lamp is turned off.\n\n### 8.2.4. Perception of color\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to be aware of the limitations of our\nown visual system, and not to believe that we are in possession of a\nperfect \"eyeball spectrometer\" (though it is quite good in many\ncircumstances). In fact, we have three types of color receptive **cone\ncells** in our retinas (unless you have some form of colorblindness).\nOrganisms with these *trichromatic* visual systems have dye molecules in\nthese light-sensitive cells that respond most strongly to red, green,\nand blue light. By mixing different ratios of these colors (see Figure\n(8.5), below), it is possible for an RGB display (like the one you are\nlooking at if you are reading this on a screen) to generate the\nperception of any color by triggering these three different cone cells\nin the right ratios. For example, a lot of red and slightly less green\nwould be perceived as yellow centering around 570 nm. A true yellow\nlight source (like an LED) would excite the same ratios of red and green\ncone cells as the \"fake\" yellow light, and the outcome would be exactly\nthe same: i.e., you would perceive yellow, even though you do not have a\nsingle cone cell that responds to yellow light.\n\n(Figure 8.5) \n>>>image(cone cells.png.0)\n\nThe photons that reach our eyes which are involved in the perception of\ncolor have either been transmitted, scattered, or emitted. If you are\nreading this on a screen, the photons have been emitted by semiconductor\nlight emitting devices behind the colored pixels, through which they are\ntransmitted. If you are reading this on paper, the light that is\nreaching your eyes has been scattered by the white paper and absorbed by\nthe black ink.[^8.2.8] You may remember from elementary school that for an\nobject to appear a certain color, it absorbs every color but the one it\nappears, which is reflected. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but\nit gets the point across, at least for opaque materials. There are\nactually a few ways that an object produces color when illuminated with\nbroad spectrum light (i.e., white light with maybe a little UV in\nthere). The following figure, (8.6), illustrates the possibilities we\nhave discussed in this chapter.\n\n(Figure 8.6) \n>>>image(summary light interaction.png.0)\n\nIn the top row, an object which is transparent to some wavelengths is\nilluminated with white light. The object (or solution of dyes or\nnanoparticles) absorbs a subset of these wavelengths in accordance with\nits band edges and density of states. The light that is not absorbed by\nthe object or solution is **transmitted** through the medium to our\neyeballs. In the second row, white light containing all the visible\nwavelengths impinges upon an absorbing medium. Some wavelengths of the\nlight are scattered. For metallic nanoparticles, absorption and\nscattering typically occur at the wavelength that corresponds to the\n**surface plasmon resonance** of the particle. That is, the wavelength\nthat is in **resonance** with the energy of the oscillating conduction\nelectrons that make up metallic bonds between metal atoms. So,\nscattering and absorption occur at the same wavelengths for these\nparticles. However, for ordinary scenarios involving colored, opaque\nobjects, the perceived color is what is scattered. So, the wavelengths\nof white light that were not absorbed by the surface are scattered and\nvisible to our eyes.\n\nFinally, light can reach our eyes through the process of direct\nemission. For example, from a fluorescent object, a light bulb, a\nglow-in-the-dark star, or even the sun. Remember that even a\nmonochromatic light source, such as a laser, which emits only at a\nsingle wavelength, triggers more than one cone cell in our eyes.\nUltimately, the perception of a color by our brain is the result of a\nsuperposition of signals arising from multiple types of color-sensitive\nnerve endings that are stimulated in a ratio that depends on the\nincoming wavelength. What the brain does with this information is\nwaaaaay outside the scope of this course. But the bottom line is that we\nperceive it as a color.\n\n[^8.2.1]: Quick; fleeting.\n\n[^8.2.2]: Specifically, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\n\n[^8.2.3]: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies yield complementary information\n    about the bonding structure of a molecule. Vibrational modes that\n    are active in FTIR are those corresponding to periodic modulation of\n    the molecule's *dipole moment*, while those active under Raman are\n    those corresponding to the molecule's *polarizability*. The\n    quintessential example of the former is CO$_2$ (the carbon atom\n    vibrating between the oxygen atoms) and that of the latter is N$_2$\n    (the nitrogen atoms getting closer together and farther apart).\n\n[^8.2.4]: Because the electron is \"re-combining\" with the positively charged\n    \"hole\" that it left in the valence band\n\n[^8.2.5]: See next paragraph.\n\n[^8.2.6]: Light emission stimulated by light.\n\n[^8.2.7]: The states are individual energy levels that can be occupied by\n    electrons, of which the state at the band edge or *frontier* is only\n    one!\n\n[^8.2.8]: Though ultimately the source of this white light is a light in the\n    room or the sun, which both generate photons by emission.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Quantum mechanical model for absorption: the particle in a box\nThere are several models one can use to predict the electronic\ntransitions and absorption properties of relatively simple absorbers\nlike organic dyes. The simplest---though it is not simple to any\nfirst-time learner---is the **particle-in-a-box** model. The most common\ntype of particle-in-a-box is an electron in an energy well with\ninfinitely hard side walls. Inside the well, the potential energy is\nzero. Beyond the walls, the potential energy is infinite. Imagine that\nan electron is placed in the well. Remember our discussion of photons as\nboth particles and waves? It turns out that *every* object can be\ntreated as both a particle and a wave. That is, even solid, macroscopic\nobjects have wavelike properties. However, for objects of appreciable\nmass, the wavelength is miniscule and the object can be treated as a\nparticle only. Thus, the wavelike properties of matter typically only\nmanifest for electrons, protons, atoms, and very small molecules.\n\nThe behavior of an electron inside the box can be described by a\n**wavefunction**, which is a solution to the **Schr\u00f6dinger equation**\n\n(Equation 8.2) $$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}=E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$, $m$ is the mass of\nthe particle (the electron in this case), $\\psi(x)$ is the wave\nfunction, $x$ is the horizontal position variable along the box, and\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}$ is the second derivative of the wave function\nwith respect to the position.[^8.3.1] The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an example\nof a **differential equation**, which is a function that is related to\nits own derivative. While there are whole courses in \"diff-eq\" that you\nwill probably take later in your studies, we can get most of the way\nthere just by looking at the equation with the sparest knowledge of\nfirst-semester or AP calculus. The question is, what function has the\nsame form as its second derivative? The answer is sine and cosine\nfunctions! After some guessing and checking, one can come up with the\nfollowing\n\n(Equation 8.3) $$\\psi_n(x)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin{\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}}$$\n\nwhere the index $n$ is an integer $\\geq$ 1. Plugging this solution back\ninto equation (8.2), we get an expression for the energy\n\n(Equation 8.4) $$E_n=\\frac{h^2n^2}{8mL^2}$$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the $n^{th}$ energy level. The shapes of\nthe wave functions and the energies of the electrons occupying these\nstates only have physical meaning in the most contrived, idealized\nscenarios. Nevertheless, wave functions can be obtained for a number of\npotentials, such as spherical ones for atoms.\n\nFigure (8.7) below shows the shapes of the wave functions for $n=1$,\ntermed the **ground state**, $n=2$, termed the **first excited state**,\nand $n=3$, the **second excited state**.[^8.3.2] In these diagrams, the wave\nfunction $\\psi(x)$ is the **probability amplitude**; it shows the shape\nof the wave function, and in particular the phases (i.e., above and\nbelow an imaginary horizontal line separating the \"positive\" and\n\"negative\" regions of the function). The square of this function,\n$|\\psi(x)|^2$, is the **probability density**, which is positive (above\nthe horizontal line) everywhere. That is, the function which shows where\nyou are most likely to find the electron within the box. This function\nintegrates to 1, since that is the probability of finding the electron\nsomewhere in the box.\n\n(Figure 8.7) \n>>>image(energy_levels.png.0)\n\n### 8.3.1. Organic dyes and the color of carrots\n\nThe particle-in-a-box model can first seem very obscure. What it is it\ngood for? It turns out that the particle-in-a-box model is most useful\nin determining energy *differences* between states. Often, what we care\nabout most are the gaps between the valence band and the conduction band\nof a molecule or a solid. In some (idealized) cases, it is even possible\nto get a number that's in the right ballpark of the correct value for a\nphysical system. Consider the structure of $\\beta$-carotene, below\n(Figure (8.8)).\n\n(Figure 8.8) \n>>>image(betacarotene.png.0)\n\n$\\beta$-Carotene is the structure most commonly associated with the\norange color of carrots, though in pure form it is more red than orange.\nThe most striking structural feature of $\\beta$-carotene is its long\nconjugated core (that is, alternating double and single bonds). Such a\nstructure gives rise to absorption in the visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.[^8.3.3] It is actually possible to use the\nparticle-in-a-box model to predict that $\\beta$-carotene absorbs in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. Furthermore, if we are a little loose\nwith some of the parameters, we can get it to appear orange.\n\nTo start out, we need to know the approximate length of the\n$\\pi$-conjugated **chromophore**[^8.3.4] and the number of electrons in it.\nLet's say a good approximation is 18.5 \u00c5. Looking at the structure in\nFigure (8.8), we see that there are 22 carbon atoms involved in the\n$\\pi$ system. From general chemistry, we know that some number of\n**atomic orbitals** give rise to the same number of **molecular\norbitals**. So, we will expect to have 22 total molecular orbitals. An\norbital is a place where electrons live, and it can be defined\nmathematically by a wave function, $\\psi(x)$. As you may also remember,\neach bonding molecular orbital gets two electrons, so the first 11 wave\nfunctions starting with the lowest energy---representing the 11\n**bonding orbitals** of $\\beta$-carotene---are filled, while the top 11\nwave functions---representing the **antibonding orbitals** are empty.\nThe bonding orbitals can be treated as the valence band, and the\nantibonding orbitals can be treated as the conduction band. The **band\ngap** is defined as the difference in energy between the **highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)** (i.e., the valence band edge) and\nthe **lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)** (i.e., the conduction\nband edge). Convince yourself that the difference in energy is given by\nthe following equation:\n\n(Equation 8.5) $$\\Delta E = (n_f^2 - n_i^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ is the initial state and $n_f$ is the final state. When the\nmolecule absorbs a photon, the electron is promoted from $n_i$ to $n_f$.\nIf these two states correspond to the band edges, then $n_i=11$ and\n$n_f=12$. So,\n\n$$\\Delta E = (12^2 - 11^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23 \\times (6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js})^2}{8 (9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})(1.85 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m})^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{490 \\, \\text{nm}}$$\n\n\nThe real bandgap of $\\beta$-carotene is closer to 470 nm, but we should\nbe surprised that this super simple model got as close as it did. After\nall, 18.5 \u00c5 is not quite the length of the $\\pi$ system, however, we\nalso ignored all of the electrostatic effects of the protons, the fact\nthat these molecules are twisting and dancing all over the place, and\nthe fact that the electrons are not truly **delocalized**. That is, in a\nreal molecule---not the fake construct of a box with infinite\nwalls---the electrons are not free to occupy any of the length of the\n\"box\" defined by the $\\pi$ system.\n\n### 8.3.2. Quantum dots\n\nA quantum dot is a clever nickname for a **semiconductor nanocrystal**.\nThe moniker \"dot\" emphasizes the quantization of the energy levels. Just\nlike the particle in a box, a quantum dot has **quantized**---can only\ntake on a predefined set of energies---absorption and emission behavior.\nQuantum dots can be made of any direct-bandgap semiconductor, but are\noften metal chalcogenides, including cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe), and lead sulfide (PbS). However, any small\nsemiconductor particle with quantized energy levels will exhibit\nquantum-dot-like behavior. Small platelets of graphene will even\nqualify: **graphene quantum dots**.\n\nThe energy of absorption and emission in a quantum dot follows the same\nqualitative trend as in the particle-in-a-box model: the smaller the\ndot, the more confined the electron, the larger the bandgap, and thus\nthe bluer (higher energy!) the absorption and emission. It is common to\nsee pretty photographs of fluorescent quantum dots like the drawing in\nFigure (8.9), which emphasizes the relationship between particle size\nand band gap.\n\n(Figure 8.9) \n>>>image(quantum dot.png.0)\n\nThe energy of emission of a quantum dot can be predicted by calculating\nits band gap, as determined by\n\n(Equation 8.6)\n$$E_{QD} = E_{bulk} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2a^2} (\\frac{1}{m_e} + \\frac{1}{m_h}) - \\frac{1.8e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\epsilon_0a}$$\n\nwhere the first term is the energy of the bandgap of the bulk\nsemiconductor (i.e., a block of the material of macroscopic extent), the\nsecond term is due to size confinement (i.e., the particle-in-a-box\nenergy), and the third term is the Coulombic attraction between the\nelectron and the hole. $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$,\nand $a$ is the radius of the quantum dot. The band gap of the quantum\ndot is greater than that of the bulk semiconductor by an amount related\nto the particle-in-a-box energy (notice the similarity of the second\nterm of equation (8.6) to that of equation (8.5)). In this case, $m_e$\nand $m_h$ are the masses of the electron and hole.[^8.3.5] Finally, the\nenergy of the bandgap of the quantum dot is reduced by the (favorable)\nattraction between the electron and hole. In fact, the final term in\nequation (8.6) looks a lot like Coulomb's law, equation (2.1).\n\n[^8.3.1]: Don't get scared if you haven't learned calculus before. The first\n    derivative is the rate of change of a function with respect to the\n    variable in the denominator; the second derivative is the rate of\n    change of this rate of change. The second derivative is analogous to\n    the acceleration being the derivative of the velocity, which itself\n    is the derivative of the displacement with respect to time. So, if\n    the function is the displacement, the first derivative is the\n    velocity, and the second derivative is the acceleration.\n\n[^8.3.2]: Note the naming convention where $n=2$ is somehow the first of\n    something.

In fact,\n    $\\beta$-carotene is a p-type semiconductor and can be used to make\n    solar cells and thin-film transistors.\n\n[^8.3.4]: The chromophore is the part of the molecule that makes it colored.\n\n[^8.3.5]: Wait, how can a hole have a mass? Because as the hole moves, an\n    electron backfills the hole, and the electron has mass.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Properties of light\nEverything you see around you is ultimately the result of light waves\ninteracting with molecular structures, nanostructures, and\nsurfaces---i.e., **light-matter interactions**. These light waves engage\nthe matter in various ways, and some of them are conveyed back to you to\ncreate an image on your retina. The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Scattering, absorption, and nothing\nWhen a photon strikes an object, three things can happen:\n**scattering**, **absorption**, and **nothing**. Which of these\neventualities occurs depends on the size, shape, atomic composition, and\nvarious idiosyncracies of the chunk of matter under consideration.\n\n### 8.2.1. Scattering\n\nScattering is the process of absorption and re-emission of a photon in\nrapid succession. In fact, most of the photons that arrive at our\nretinas have been scattered by the objects we perceive in our visual\nfield. Absorption and re-emission occurs by transient[^8.2.1] polarization\nof the electron cloud of the atoms that make up an object; when the\nelectron cloud returns to its unpolarized equilibrium, a photon is\nre-emitted. This re-emitted photon is known as the **scattered photon**.\n\n#### Elastic and inelastic scattering\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is either greater than, less than, or\nequal to the energy of the incident photon. In the case where the\nscattered photon has the same energy as that of the incident photon, the\nscattering process is deemed **elastic** or **Rayleigh** scattering.\nThat is, energy was neither absorbed by the material nor transferred to\nthe photon as a result of the collision. When the energy is greater than\nor less than that of the incident photon, the process is said to be\n**inelastic** or **Raman** scattering. That is, energy is either\nabsorbed by the material or transferred from the material to the photon.\nA schematic diagram of the two scattering processes is shown in Figure\n(8.2).\n\n(Figure 8.2) \n>>>image(scattering.png.0)\n\nInelastic scattering---the type of scattering where energy is absorbed\nby the material as a result of the collision---is by far the more common\ntype. In this case, the energy of the scattered photon is less than the\nenergy of the incident photon (longer wavelength). The \"missing\" energy\nfrom the incident photon often goes into raising the vibrational energy\nof the scatterer. That is, energy gets transferred from the incident\nphoton to the scatterer, which is initially in a low-energy vibrational\nstate. The scatterer absorbs some of this energy, knocking it up to a\nhigher energy vibrational state (i.e., vibrating at a higher frequency).\nThe downward shift in the energy of the scattered photon with respect to\nthat of the incident photon is called a **Stokes shift**, which just\nmeans that the scattered photon has less energy than the incident\nphoton. You may also see the word **red shift** or the super jargony\nword ***bathochromic* shift**.\n\n#### Vibrational spectroscopy: Infrared and Raman\n\nSometimes, a scatterer is already in a higher (excited) vibrational\nstate, and in the process of collision with the incoming photon, this\nextra energy is transferred to the scattered photon. The scattered\nphoton thus has increased energy (shorter wavelength) compared to the\nenergy of the incident photon. The shift in wavelength of the scattered\nphoton relative to the incident photon is called an **anti-Stokes**\nshift, a **blue shift**, or a ***hypsochromic* shift**. Vibrational\ntransitions, which are are usually in the infrared region of the EM\nspectrum, can be observed directly by infrared absorption\nspectroscopy[^8.2.2] or indirectly upon irradiation with a laser of a\nvisible wavelength, by **Raman spectroscopy**. In this modality, the\nenergy of the vibrational transition is equal to the difference in\nenergy between the incident and scattered light.[^8.2.3]\n\nThe differences in energy between incident and scattered or emitted\nphotons is the basis of the field of **spectroscopy**. It is often\npossible to reveal something about the construction of molecules and the\ncomposition of matter by analyzing the *spectra* produced by\nlight-matter interactions. These spectra can act as fingerprints unique\nto the interaction taking place, and like detectives at the scene of a\ncrime, we can use spectroscopy help identify the matter of interest. We\nwill touch on electronic absorption (ultraviolet-visible) and\nfluorescence spectroscopy in later sections in this chapter.\n\n### 8.2.2. Absorption due to the movement of electrons\n\nAs we hinted in the discussion of scattering, it is common for some or\nall of the energy of an incident photon to be absorbed by the material\nor molecule. We touched on changes in vibrational energy levels that can\noccur upon absorption, but such differences usually take place in the\ninfrared spectrum. For optoelectronic applications (e.g., solar cells\nand display panels), we are often more interested in those that occur in\nthe visible range of the EM spectrum. The molecular basis for visible\nabsorption usually involves promotion of electrons from the **conduction\nband** or **bonding orbitals** to the **valence band** or **antibonding\norbitals**. These transitions are interesting because they can indicate\nchemical activity such as bond breakage or photon-driven charge\nseparation in solar cells. In Figure (8.3), we see a diagram of the band\nenergies for a generic material that absorbs light in the visible region\nof the EM spectrum (i.e., a dye molecule, a semiconductor, or a quantum\ndot).\n\n(Figure 8.3) \n>>>image(orbitals.png.0)\n\nYou might ask why, if the band gap energy has a specific value (say, 2.5\nelectron volts), the absorption spectrum is a broad hump and not a sharp\nvertical line. Indeed, for a completely isolated, single molecule at a\ntemperature of absolute zero, one might obtain a single vertical line.\nThe reason this does not happen in the real world is that the gap\nbetween the valence and conduction bands is a measure of the gap between\nthe **frontiers** or **edges** of these bands. When a molecule is in\nsolution and in van der Waals contact with nearby molecules, the energy\nlevels become blurry. That is, there are many energy states above and\nbelow these levels to and from which electrons can be excited by an\nincoming photon. The function that describes the distribution of energy\nlevels is called the **density of states**. It is this interplay of\nlight and electronic energy levels---combined with the phenomena in\nscattering---that gives rise to the perception of color.\n\n### 8.2.3. Emission: Fluorescence and Phosphorescence\n\nSuppose a molecule absorbs a photon, and an electron that was initially\nin the ground state (say at the valence band edge) gets promoted to a\nhigher energy level (say the conduction band edge). The potential energy\nof the electron is now substantially greater than it was before, and\nthis is an unstable situation. The electron will tend to return to its\nground state, and can do so in a number of ways. For example, it can\ncollide with some other molecules, which take on some of the energy as\ntranslational motion, and the electron eventually makes its way back to\nthe valence band. This process is called **non-radiative\nrecombination**[^8.2.4]. Alternatively, the electron can transfer its energy\nto another molecule, whose electron gets promoted, while the electron of\nthe original molecule returns to its ground state. This type of energy\ntransfer can be mediated by a photon---i.e., emitted by the first\nmolecule and absorbed by the second---or it can occur through space,\nwithout the emission of a photon. When the non-photon process occurs, it\nis called **F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)**, and tends to\noccur when the emission spectrum of the first molecule overlaps with the\nabsorption spectrum of the second. Finally, the excited electron may\ndecay to the ground state by emitting a photon similar, but not usually\nidentical,[^8.2.5] to the band gap in two related processes known as\n*fluorescence* and *phosphorescence*.\n\n#### Photoluminescence I: Fluorescence\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with a black light (i.e., near-visible,\nUV-A light) or pointed one at various objects to see if anything glows,\nthat glowing is a type of **photoluminescence**[^8.2.6] called\n**fluorescence**. In general, fluorescence occurs when high-energy light\nis absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule or material as lower-energy\nlight. To see why this is, consider Figure (8.4) shown below.\n\n(Figure 8.4) \n>>>image(thermalization.png.0)\n\nThe band gap has a specific energy and it is true that photons with\nenergies *below* the band gap do not get absorbed. However, we know that\nphotons with energies *above* than the band gap get absorbed all the\ntime. When an electron gets excited by such a high-energy photon, where\ndoes it go? The answer is that it gets promoted to one of the energy\nlevels above the band edge with a probability based on the **density of\nstates**.[^8.2.7] Once the electron is in this higher-energy state, it\nquickly transitions down to the band edge by releasing its energy into\nthe bulk material (or solution) as heat. This process, known as\n**thermalization**, ensures that the starting point for every\nfluorescent process starts with the electron at the bottom of the\nconduction band. While these electrons may return to the energy level\nexactly at the edge of the valence band, it is more likely that they too\nwill find a band with a lower energy than the band edge. Again, this\nprocess is determined by the density of states, this time below the band\nedge. These processes ensure that the energy of the absorption spectrum\nfor a molecule or material is centered in a range higher than that of\nthe fluorescence spectrum.\n\n#### Photoluminescence II: Phosphorescence\n\nThe day I wrote this sentence, I helped my three-year-old daughter put\nconstellations of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of her bedroom.\nAt first, the glow emitted by glow-in-the-dark stickers, plastic, and\npaint seems like it might be fluorescent. However, fluorescent items\nstop glowing as soon as we turn off the excitation sources, whereas\nglow-in-the-dark materials stay lit for several minutes or even hours.\nThis long-lasting glow is indicative of a process known as\n**phosphorescence**. Phosphorescence occurs when the **spin** of an\nexcited electron changes sign (i.e., from \"up\" to \"down\" or vice versa).\nSuch an electron enters a new manifold of energy states in a process\ncalled **intersystem crossing**. From this new manifold of energy\nstates, the spin of the electron must go back to its original spin in\norder to transition back down to its original ground state. This\ntransition is quantum mechanically \"forbidden.\" It still happens, but\nwith a lower probability and thus it takes a long time. Hence why the\nstars glow long after the lamp is turned off.\n\n### 8.2.4. Perception of color\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to be aware of the limitations of our\nown visual system, and not to believe that we are in possession of a\nperfect \"eyeball spectrometer\" (though it is quite good in many\ncircumstances). In fact, we have three types of color receptive **cone\ncells** in our retinas (unless you have some form of colorblindness).\nOrganisms with these *trichromatic* visual systems have dye molecules in\nthese light-sensitive cells that respond most strongly to red, green,\nand blue light. By mixing different ratios of these colors (see Figure\n(8.5), below), it is possible for an RGB display (like the one you are\nlooking at if you are reading this on a screen) to generate the\nperception of any color by triggering these three different cone cells\nin the right ratios. For example, a lot of red and slightly less green\nwould be perceived as yellow centering around 570 nm. A true yellow\nlight source (like an LED) would excite the same ratios of red and green\ncone cells as the \"fake\" yellow light, and the outcome would be exactly\nthe same: i.e., you would perceive yellow, even though you do not have a\nsingle cone cell that responds to yellow light.\n\n(Figure 8.5) \n>>>image(cone cells.png.0)\n\nThe photons that reach our eyes which are involved in the perception of\ncolor have either been transmitted, scattered, or emitted. If you are\nreading this on a screen, the photons have been emitted by semiconductor\nlight emitting devices behind the colored pixels, through which they are\ntransmitted. If you are reading this on paper, the light that is\nreaching your eyes has been scattered by the white paper and absorbed by\nthe black ink.[^8.2.8] You may remember from elementary school that for an\nobject to appear a certain color, it absorbs every color but the one it\nappears, which is reflected. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but\nit gets the point across, at least for opaque materials. There are\nactually a few ways that an object produces color when illuminated with\nbroad spectrum light (i.e., white light with maybe a little UV in\nthere). The following figure, (8.6), illustrates the possibilities we\nhave discussed in this chapter.\n\n(Figure 8.6) \n>>>image(summary light interaction.png.0)\n\nIn the top row, an object which is transparent to some wavelengths is\nilluminated with white light. The object (or solution of dyes or\nnanoparticles) absorbs a subset of these wavelengths in accordance with\nits band edges and density of states. The light that is not absorbed by\nthe object or solution is **transmitted** through the medium to our\neyeballs. In the second row, white light containing all the visible\nwavelengths impinges upon an absorbing medium. Some wavelengths of the\nlight are scattered. For metallic nanoparticles, absorption and\nscattering typically occur at the wavelength that corresponds to the\n**surface plasmon resonance** of the particle. That is, the wavelength\nthat is in **resonance** with the energy of the oscillating conduction\nelectrons that make up metallic bonds between metal atoms. So,\nscattering and absorption occur at the same wavelengths for these\nparticles. However, for ordinary scenarios involving colored, opaque\nobjects, the perceived color is what is scattered. So, the wavelengths\nof white light that were not absorbed by the surface are scattered and\nvisible to our eyes.\n\nFinally, light can reach our eyes through the process of direct\nemission. For example, from a fluorescent object, a light bulb, a\nglow-in-the-dark star, or even the sun. Remember that even a\nmonochromatic light source, such as a laser, which emits only at a\nsingle wavelength, triggers more than one cone cell in our eyes.\nUltimately, the perception of a color by our brain is the result of a\nsuperposition of signals arising from multiple types of color-sensitive\nnerve endings that are stimulated in a ratio that depends on the\nincoming wavelength. What the brain does with this information is\nwaaaaay outside the scope of this course. But the bottom line is that we\nperceive it as a color.\n\n[^8.2.1]: Quick; fleeting.\n\n[^8.2.2]: Specifically, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\n\n[^8.2.3]: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies yield complementary information\n    about the bonding structure of a molecule. Vibrational modes that\n    are active in FTIR are those corresponding to periodic modulation of\n    the molecule's *dipole moment*, while those active under Raman are\n    those corresponding to the molecule's *polarizability*. The\n    quintessential example of the former is CO$_2$ (the carbon atom\n    vibrating between the oxygen atoms) and that of the latter is N$_2$\n    (the nitrogen atoms getting closer together and farther apart).\n\n[^8.2.4]: Because the electron is \"re-combining\" with the positively charged\n    \"hole\" that it left in the valence band\n\n[^8.2.5]: See next paragraph.\n\n[^8.2.6]: Light emission stimulated by light.\n\n[^8.2.7]: The states are individual energy levels that can be occupied by\n    electrons, of which the state at the band edge or *frontier* is only\n    one!\n\n[^8.2.8]: Though ultimately the source of this white light is a light in the\n    room or the sun, which both generate photons by emission.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Quantum mechanical model for absorption: the particle in a box\nThere are several models one can use to predict the electronic\ntransitions and absorption properties of relatively simple absorbers\nlike organic dyes. The simplest---though it is not simple to any\nfirst-time learner---is the **particle-in-a-box** model. The most common\ntype of particle-in-a-box is an electron in an energy well with\ninfinitely hard side walls. Inside the well, the potential energy is\nzero. Beyond the walls, the potential energy is infinite. Imagine that\nan electron is placed in the well. Remember our discussion of photons as\nboth particles and waves? It turns out that *every* object can be\ntreated as both a particle and a wave. That is, even solid, macroscopic\nobjects have wavelike properties. However, for objects of appreciable\nmass, the wavelength is miniscule and the object can be treated as a\nparticle only. Thus, the wavelike properties of matter typically only\nmanifest for electrons, protons, atoms, and very small molecules.\n\nThe behavior of an electron inside the box can be described by a\n**wavefunction**, which is a solution to the **Schr\u00f6dinger equation**\n\n(Equation 8.2) $$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}=E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$, $m$ is the mass of\nthe particle (the electron in this case), $\\psi(x)$ is the wave\nfunction, $x$ is the horizontal position variable along the box, and\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}$ is the second derivative of the wave function\nwith respect to the position.[^8.3.1] The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an example\nof a **differential equation**, which is a function that is related to\nits own derivative. While there are whole courses in \"diff-eq\" that you\nwill probably take later in your studies, we can get most of the way\nthere just by looking at the equation with the sparest knowledge of\nfirst-semester or AP calculus. The question is, what function has the\nsame form as its second derivative? The answer is sine and cosine\nfunctions! After some guessing and checking, one can come up with the\nfollowing\n\n(Equation 8.3) $$\\psi_n(x)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin{\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}}$$\n\nwhere the index $n$ is an integer $\\geq$ 1. Plugging this solution back\ninto equation (8.2), we get an expression for the energy\n\n(Equation 8.4) $$E_n=\\frac{h^2n^2}{8mL^2}$$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the $n^{th}$ energy level. The shapes of\nthe wave functions and the energies of the electrons occupying these\nstates only have physical meaning in the most contrived, idealized\nscenarios. Nevertheless, wave functions can be obtained for a number of\npotentials, such as spherical ones for atoms.\n\nFigure (8.7) below shows the shapes of the wave functions for $n=1$,\ntermed the **ground state**, $n=2$, termed the **first excited state**,\nand $n=3$, the **second excited state**.[^8.3.2] In these diagrams, the wave\nfunction $\\psi(x)$ is the **probability amplitude**; it shows the shape\nof the wave function, and in particular the phases (i.e., above and\nbelow an imaginary horizontal line separating the \"positive\" and\n\"negative\" regions of the function). The square of this function,\n$|\\psi(x)|^2$, is the **probability density**, which is positive (above\nthe horizontal line) everywhere. That is, the function which shows where\nyou are most likely to find the electron within the box. This function\nintegrates to 1, since that is the probability of finding the electron\nsomewhere in the box.\n\n(Figure 8.7) \n>>>image(energy_levels.png.0)\n\n### 8.3.1. Organic dyes and the color of carrots\n\nThe particle-in-a-box model can first seem very obscure. What it is it\ngood for? It turns out that the particle-in-a-box model is most useful\nin determining energy *differences* between states. Often, what we care\nabout most are the gaps between the valence band and the conduction band\nof a molecule or a solid. In some (idealized) cases, it is even possible\nto get a number that's in the right ballpark of the correct value for a\nphysical system. Consider the structure of $\\beta$-carotene, below\n(Figure (8.8)).\n\n(Figure 8.8) \n>>>image(betacarotene.png.0)\n\n$\\beta$-Carotene is the structure most commonly associated with the\norange color of carrots, though in pure form it is more red than orange.\nThe most striking structural feature of $\\beta$-carotene is its long\nconjugated core (that is, alternating double and single bonds). Such a\nstructure gives rise to absorption in the visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.[^8.3.3] It is actually possible to use the\nparticle-in-a-box model to predict that $\\beta$-carotene absorbs in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. Furthermore, if we are a little loose\nwith some of the parameters, we can get it to appear orange.\n\nTo start out, we need to know the approximate length of the\n$\\pi$-conjugated **chromophore**[^8.3.4] and the number of electrons in it.\nLet's say a good approximation is 18.5 \u00c5. Looking at the structure in\nFigure (8.8), we see that there are 22 carbon atoms involved in the\n$\\pi$ system. From general chemistry, we know that some number of\n**atomic orbitals** give rise to the same number of **molecular\norbitals**. So, we will expect to have 22 total molecular orbitals. An\norbital is a place where electrons live, and it can be defined\nmathematically by a wave function, $\\psi(x)$. As you may also remember,\neach bonding molecular orbital gets two electrons, so the first 11 wave\nfunctions starting with the lowest energy---representing the 11\n**bonding orbitals** of $\\beta$-carotene---are filled, while the top 11\nwave functions---representing the **antibonding orbitals** are empty.\nThe bonding orbitals can be treated as the valence band, and the\nantibonding orbitals can be treated as the conduction band. The **band\ngap** is defined as the difference in energy between the **highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)** (i.e., the valence band edge) and\nthe **lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)** (i.e., the conduction\nband edge). Convince yourself that the difference in energy is given by\nthe following equation:\n\n(Equation 8.5) $$\\Delta E = (n_f^2 - n_i^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ is the initial state and $n_f$ is the final state. When the\nmolecule absorbs a photon, the electron is promoted from $n_i$ to $n_f$.\nIf these two states correspond to the band edges, then $n_i=11$ and\n$n_f=12$. So,\n\n$$\\Delta E = (12^2 - 11^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23 \\times (6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js})^2}{8 (9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})(1.85 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m})^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{490 \\, \\text{nm}}$$\n\n\nThe real bandgap of $\\beta$-carotene is closer to 470 nm, but we should\nbe surprised that this super simple model got as close as it did. After\nall, 18.5 \u00c5 is not quite the length of the $\\pi$ system, however, we\nalso ignored all of the electrostatic effects of the protons, the fact\nthat these molecules are twisting and dancing all over the place, and\nthe fact that the electrons are not truly **delocalized**. That is, in a\nreal molecule---not the fake construct of a box with infinite\nwalls---the electrons are not free to occupy any of the length of the\n\"box\" defined by the $\\pi$ system.\n\n### 8.3.2. Quantum dots\n\nA quantum dot is a clever nickname for a **semiconductor nanocrystal**.\nThe moniker \"dot\" emphasizes the quantization of the energy levels. Just\nlike the particle in a box, a quantum dot has **quantized**---can only\ntake on a predefined set of energies---absorption and emission behavior.\nQuantum dots can be made of any direct-bandgap semiconductor, but are\noften metal chalcogenides, including cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe), and lead sulfide (PbS). However, any small\nsemiconductor particle with quantized energy levels will exhibit\nquantum-dot-like behavior. Small platelets of graphene will even\nqualify: **graphene quantum dots**.\n\nThe energy of absorption and emission in a quantum dot follows the same\nqualitative trend as in the particle-in-a-box model: the smaller the\ndot, the more confined the electron, the larger the bandgap, and thus\nthe bluer (higher energy!) the absorption and emission. It is common to\nsee pretty photographs of fluorescent quantum dots like the drawing in\nFigure (8.9), which emphasizes the relationship between particle size\nand band gap.\n\n(Figure 8.9) \n>>>image(quantum dot.png.0)\n\nThe energy of emission of a quantum dot can be predicted by calculating\nits band gap, as determined by\n\n(Equation 8.6)\n$$E_{QD} = E_{bulk} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2a^2} (\\frac{1}{m_e} + \\frac{1}{m_h}) - \\frac{1.8e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\epsilon_0a}$$\n\nwhere the first term is the energy of the bandgap of the bulk\nsemiconductor (i.e., a block of the material of macroscopic extent), the\nsecond term is due to size confinement (i.e., the particle-in-a-box\nenergy), and the third term is the Coulombic attraction between the\nelectron and the hole. $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$,\nand $a$ is the radius of the quantum dot. The band gap of the quantum\ndot is greater than that of the bulk semiconductor by an amount related\nto the particle-in-a-box energy (notice the similarity of the second\nterm of equation (8.6) to that of equation (8.5)). In this case, $m_e$\nand $m_h$ are the masses of the electron and hole.[^8.3.5] Finally, the\nenergy of the bandgap of the quantum dot is reduced by the (favorable)\nattraction between the electron and hole. In fact, the final term in\nequation (8.6) looks a lot like Coulomb's law, equation (2.1).\n\n[^8.3.1]: Don't get scared if you haven't learned calculus before. The first\n    derivative is the rate of change of a function with respect to the\n    variable in the denominator; the second derivative is the rate of\n    change of this rate of change. The second derivative is analogous to\n    the acceleration being the derivative of the velocity, which itself\n    is the derivative of the displacement with respect to time. So, if\n    the function is the displacement, the first derivative is the\n    velocity, and the second derivative is the acceleration.\n\n[^8.3.2]: Note the naming convention where $n=2$ is somehow the first of\n    something. Even the best of us mess this up at least once in our\n    lives.\n\n[^8.3.3]: It also gives it semiconducting behavior. In fact,\n    $\\beta$-carotene is a p-type semiconductor and can be used to make\n    solar cells and thin-film transistors.\n\n[^8.3.4]: The chromophore is the part of the molecule that makes it colored.\n\n[^8.3.5]: Wait, how can a hole have a mass? Because as the hole moves, an\n    electron backfills the hole, and the electron has mass.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Properties of light\nEverything you see around you is ultimately the result of light waves\ninteracting with molecular structures, nanostructures, and\nsurfaces---i.e., **light-matter interactions**. These light waves engage\nthe matter in various ways, and some of them are conveyed back to you to\ncreate an image on your retina. The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Scattering, absorption, and nothing\nWhen a photon strikes an object, three things can happen:\n**scattering**, **absorption**, and **nothing**. Which of these\neventualities occurs depends on the size, shape, atomic composition, and\nvarious idiosyncracies of the chunk of matter under consideration.\n\n### 8.2.1. Scattering\n\nScattering is the process of absorption and re-emission of a photon in\nrapid succession. In fact, most of the photons that arrive at our\nretinas have been scattered by the objects we perceive in our visual\nfield. Absorption and re-emission occurs by transient[^8.2.1] polarization\nof the electron cloud of the atoms that make up an object; when the\nelectron cloud returns to its unpolarized equilibrium, a photon is\nre-emitted. This re-emitted photon is known as the **scattered photon**.\n\n#### Elastic and inelastic scattering\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is either greater than, less than, or\nequal to the energy of the incident photon. In the case where the\nscattered photon has the same energy as that of the incident photon, the\nscattering process is deemed **elastic** or **Rayleigh** scattering.\nThat is, energy was neither absorbed by the material nor transferred to\nthe photon as a result of the collision. When the energy is greater than\nor less than that of the incident photon, the process is said to be\n**inelastic** or **Raman** scattering. That is, energy is either\nabsorbed by the material or transferred from the material to the photon.\nA schematic diagram of the two scattering processes is shown in Figure\n(8.2).\n\n(Figure 8.2) \n>>>image(scattering.png.0)\n\nInelastic scattering---the type of scattering where energy is absorbed\nby the material as a result of the collision---is by far the more common\ntype. In this case, the energy of the scattered photon is less than the\nenergy of the incident photon (longer wavelength). The \"missing\" energy\nfrom the incident photon often goes into raising the vibrational energy\nof the scatterer. That is, energy gets transferred from the incident\nphoton to the scatterer, which is initially in a low-energy vibrational\nstate. The scatterer absorbs some of this energy, knocking it up to a\nhigher energy vibrational state (i.e., vibrating at a higher frequency).\nThe downward shift in the energy of the scattered photon with respect to\nthat of the incident photon is called a **Stokes shift**, which just\nmeans that the scattered photon has less energy than the incident\nphoton. You may also see the word **red shift** or the super jargony\nword ***bathochromic* shift**.\n\n#### Vibrational spectroscopy: Infrared and Raman\n\nSometimes, a scatterer is already in a higher (excited) vibrational\nstate, and in the process of collision with the incoming photon, this\nextra energy is transferred to the scattered photon. The scattered\nphoton thus has increased energy (shorter wavelength) compared to the\nenergy of the incident photon. The shift in wavelength of the scattered\nphoton relative to the incident photon is called an **anti-Stokes**\nshift, a **blue shift**, or a ***hypsochromic* shift**. Vibrational\ntransitions, which are are usually in the infrared region of the EM\nspectrum, can be observed directly by infrared absorption\nspectroscopy[^8.2.2] or indirectly upon irradiation with a laser of a\nvisible wavelength, by **Raman spectroscopy**. In this modality, the\nenergy of the vibrational transition is equal to the difference in\nenergy between the incident and scattered light.[^8.2.3]\n\nThe differences in energy between incident and scattered or emitted\nphotons is the basis of the field of **spectroscopy**. It is often\npossible to reveal something about the construction of molecules and the\ncomposition of matter by analyzing the *spectra* produced by\nlight-matter interactions. These spectra can act as fingerprints unique\nto the interaction taking place, and like detectives at the scene of a\ncrime, we can use spectroscopy help identify the matter of interest. We\nwill touch on electronic absorption (ultraviolet-visible) and\nfluorescence spectroscopy in later sections in this chapter.\n\n### 8.2.2. Absorption due to the movement of electrons\n\nAs we hinted in the discussion of scattering, it is common for some or\nall of the energy of an incident photon to be absorbed by the material\nor molecule. We touched on changes in vibrational energy levels that can\noccur upon absorption, but such differences usually take place in the\ninfrared spectrum. For optoelectronic applications (e.g., solar cells\nand display panels), we are often more interested in those that occur in\nthe visible range of the EM spectrum. The molecular basis for visible\nabsorption usually involves promotion of electrons from the **conduction\nband** or **bonding orbitals** to the **valence band** or **antibonding\norbitals**. These transitions are interesting because they can indicate\nchemical activity such as bond breakage or photon-driven charge\nseparation in solar cells. In Figure (8.3), we see a diagram of the band\nenergies for a generic material that absorbs light in the visible region\nof the EM spectrum (i.e., a dye molecule, a semiconductor, or a quantum\ndot).\n\n(Figure 8.3) \n>>>image(orbitals.png.0)\n\nYou might ask why, if the band gap energy has a specific value (say, 2.5\nelectron volts), the absorption spectrum is a broad hump and not a sharp\nvertical line. Indeed, for a completely isolated, single molecule at a\ntemperature of absolute zero, one might obtain a single vertical line.\nThe reason this does not happen in the real world is that the gap\nbetween the valence and conduction bands is a measure of the gap between\nthe **frontiers** or **edges** of these bands. When a molecule is in\nsolution and in van der Waals contact with nearby molecules, the energy\nlevels become blurry. That is, there are many energy states above and\nbelow these levels to and from which electrons can be excited by an\nincoming photon. The function that describes the distribution of energy\nlevels is called the **density of states**. It is this interplay of\nlight and electronic energy levels---combined with the phenomena in\nscattering---that gives rise to the perception of color.\n\n### 8.2.3. Emission: Fluorescence and Phosphorescence\n\nSuppose a molecule absorbs a photon, and an electron that was initially\nin the ground state (say at the valence band edge) gets promoted to a\nhigher energy level (say the conduction band edge). The potential energy\nof the electron is now substantially greater than it was before, and\nthis is an unstable situation. The electron will tend to return to its\nground state, and can do so in a number of ways. For example, it can\ncollide with some other molecules, which take on some of the energy as\ntranslational motion, and the electron eventually makes its way back to\nthe valence band. This process is called **non-radiative\nrecombination**[^8.2.4]. Alternatively, the electron can transfer its energy\nto another molecule, whose electron gets promoted, while the electron of\nthe original molecule returns to its ground state. This type of energy\ntransfer can be mediated by a photon---i.e., emitted by the first\nmolecule and absorbed by the second---or it can occur through space,\nwithout the emission of a photon. When the non-photon process occurs, it\nis called **F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)**, and tends to\noccur when the emission spectrum of the first molecule overlaps with the\nabsorption spectrum of the second. Finally, the excited electron may\ndecay to the ground state by emitting a photon similar, but not usually\nidentical,[^8.2.5] to the band gap in two related processes known as\n*fluorescence* and *phosphorescence*.\n\n#### Photoluminescence I: Fluorescence\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with a black light (i.e., near-visible,\nUV-A light) or pointed one at various objects to see if anything glows,\nthat glowing is a type of **photoluminescence**[^8.2.6] called\n**fluorescence**. In general, fluorescence occurs when high-energy light\nis absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule or material as lower-energy\nlight. To see why this is, consider Figure (8.4) shown below.\n\n(Figure 8.4) \n>>>image(thermalization.png.0)\n\nThe band gap has a specific energy and it is true that photons with\nenergies *below* the band gap do not get absorbed. However, we know that\nphotons with energies *above* than the band gap get absorbed all the\ntime. When an electron gets excited by such a high-energy photon, where\ndoes it go? The answer is that it gets promoted to one of the energy\nlevels above the band edge with a probability based on the **density of\nstates**.[^8.2.7] Once the electron is in this higher-energy state, it\nquickly transitions down to the band edge by releasing its energy into\nthe bulk material (or solution) as heat. This process, known as\n**thermalization**, ensures that the starting point for every\nfluorescent process starts with the electron at the bottom of the\nconduction band. While these electrons may return to the energy level\nexactly at the edge of the valence band, it is more likely that they too\nwill find a band with a lower energy than the band edge. Again, this\nprocess is determined by the density of states, this time below the band\nedge. These processes ensure that the energy of the absorption spectrum\nfor a molecule or material is centered in a range higher than that of\nthe fluorescence spectrum.\n\n#### Photoluminescence II: Phosphorescence\n\nThe day I wrote this sentence, I helped my three-year-old daughter put\nconstellations of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of her bedroom.\nAt first, the glow emitted by glow-in-the-dark stickers, plastic, and\npaint seems like it might be fluorescent. However, fluorescent items\nstop glowing as soon as we turn off the excitation sources, whereas\nglow-in-the-dark materials stay lit for several minutes or even hours.\nThis long-lasting glow is indicative of a process known as\n**phosphorescence**. Phosphorescence occurs when the **spin** of an\nexcited electron changes sign (i.e., from \"up\" to \"down\" or vice versa).\nSuch an electron enters a new manifold of energy states in a process\ncalled **intersystem crossing**. From this new manifold of energy\nstates, the spin of the electron must go back to its original spin in\norder to transition back down to its original ground state. This\ntransition is quantum mechanically \"forbidden.\" It still happens, but\nwith a lower probability and thus it takes a long time. Hence why the\nstars glow long after the lamp is turned off.\n\n### 8.2.4. Perception of color\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to be aware of the limitations of our\nown visual system, and not to believe that we are in possession of a\nperfect \"eyeball spectrometer\" (though it is quite good in many\ncircumstances). In fact, we have three types of color receptive **cone\ncells** in our retinas (unless you have some form of colorblindness).\nOrganisms with these *trichromatic* visual systems have dye molecules in\nthese light-sensitive cells that respond most strongly to red, green,\nand blue light. By mixing different ratios of these colors (see Figure\n(8.5), below), it is possible for an RGB display (like the one you are\nlooking at if you are reading this on a screen) to generate the\nperception of any color by triggering these three different cone cells\nin the right ratios. For example, a lot of red and slightly less green\nwould be perceived as yellow centering around 570 nm. A true yellow\nlight source (like an LED) would excite the same ratios of red and green\ncone cells as the \"fake\" yellow light, and the outcome would be exactly\nthe same: i.e., you would perceive yellow, even though you do not have a\nsingle cone cell that responds to yellow light.\n\n(Figure 8.5) \n>>>image(cone cells.png.0)\n\nThe photons that reach our eyes which are involved in the perception of\ncolor have either been transmitted, scattered, or emitted. If you are\nreading this on a screen, the photons have been emitted by semiconductor\nlight emitting devices behind the colored pixels, through which they are\ntransmitted. If you are reading this on paper, the light that is\nreaching your eyes has been scattered by the white paper and absorbed by\nthe black ink.[^8.2.8] You may remember from elementary school that for an\nobject to appear a certain color, it absorbs every color but the one it\nappears, which is reflected. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but\nit gets the point across, at least for opaque materials. There are\nactually a few ways that an object produces color when illuminated with\nbroad spectrum light (i.e., white light with maybe a little UV in\nthere). The following figure, (8.6), illustrates the possibilities we\nhave discussed in this chapter.\n\n(Figure 8.6) \n>>>image(summary light interaction.png.0)\n\nIn the top row, an object which is transparent to some wavelengths is\nilluminated with white light. The object (or solution of dyes or\nnanoparticles) absorbs a subset of these wavelengths in accordance with\nits band edges and density of states. The light that is not absorbed by\nthe object or solution is **transmitted** through the medium to our\neyeballs. In the second row, white light containing all the visible\nwavelengths impinges upon an absorbing medium. Some wavelengths of the\nlight are scattered. For metallic nanoparticles, absorption and\nscattering typically occur at the wavelength that corresponds to the\n**surface plasmon resonance** of the particle. That is, the wavelength\nthat is in **resonance** with the energy of the oscillating conduction\nelectrons that make up metallic bonds between metal atoms. So,\nscattering and absorption occur at the same wavelengths for these\nparticles. However, for ordinary scenarios involving colored, opaque\nobjects, the perceived color is what is scattered. So, the wavelengths\nof white light that were not absorbed by the surface are scattered and\nvisible to our eyes.\n\nFinally, light can reach our eyes through the process of direct\nemission. For example, from a fluorescent object, a light bulb, a\nglow-in-the-dark star, or even the sun. Remember that even a\nmonochromatic light source, such as a laser, which emits only at a\nsingle wavelength, triggers more than one cone cell in our eyes.\nUltimately, the perception of a color by our brain is the result of a\nsuperposition of signals arising from multiple types of color-sensitive\nnerve endings that are stimulated in a ratio that depends on the\nincoming wavelength. What the brain does with this information is\nwaaaaay outside the scope of this course. But the bottom line is that we\nperceive it as a color.\n\n[^8.2.1]: Quick; fleeting.\n\n[^8.2.2]: Specifically, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\n\n[^8.2.3]: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies yield complementary information\n    about the bonding structure of a molecule. Vibrational modes that\n    are active in FTIR are those corresponding to periodic modulation of\n    the molecule's *dipole moment*, while those active under Raman are\n    those corresponding to the molecule's *polarizability*. The\n    quintessential example of the former is CO$_2$ (the carbon atom\n    vibrating between the oxygen atoms) and that of the latter is N$_2$\n    (the nitrogen atoms getting closer together and farther apart).\n\n[^8.2.4]: Because the electron is \"re-combining\" with the positively charged\n    \"hole\" that it left in the valence band\n\n[^8.2.5]: See next paragraph.\n\n[^8.2.6]: Light emission stimulated by light.\n\n[^8.2.7]: The states are individual energy levels that can be occupied by\n    electrons, of which the state at the band edge or *frontier* is only\n    one!\n\n[^8.2.8]: Though ultimately the source of this white light is a light in the\n    room or the sun, which both generate photons by emission.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Properties of light\nEverything you see around you is ultimately the result of light waves\ninteracting with molecular structures, nanostructures, and\nsurfaces---i.e., **light-matter interactions**. These light waves engage\nthe matter in various ways, and some of them are conveyed back to you to\ncreate an image on your retina. The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Scattering, absorption, and nothing\nWhen a photon strikes an object, three things can happen:\n**scattering**, **absorption**, and **nothing**. Which of these\neventualities occurs depends on the size, shape, atomic composition, and\nvarious idiosyncracies of the chunk of matter under consideration.\n\n### 8.2.1. Scattering\n\nScattering is the process of absorption and re-emission of a photon in\nrapid succession. In fact, most of the photons that arrive at our\nretinas have been scattered by the objects we perceive in our visual\nfield. Absorption and re-emission occurs by transient[^8.2.1] polarization\nof the electron cloud of the atoms that make up an object; when the\nelectron cloud returns to its unpolarized equilibrium, a photon is\nre-emitted. This re-emitted photon is known as the **scattered photon**.\n\n#### Elastic and inelastic scattering\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is either greater than, less than, or\nequal to the energy of the incident photon. In the case where the\nscattered photon has the same energy as that of the incident photon, the\nscattering process is deemed **elastic** or **Rayleigh** scattering.\nThat is, energy was neither absorbed by the material nor transferred to\nthe photon as a result of the collision. When the energy is greater than\nor less than that of the incident photon, the process is said to be\n**inelastic** or **Raman** scattering. That is, energy is either\nabsorbed by the material or transferred from the material to the photon.\nA schematic diagram of the two scattering processes is shown in Figure\n(8.2).\n\n(Figure 8.2) \n>>>image(scattering.png.0)\n\nInelastic scattering---the type of scattering where energy is absorbed\nby the material as a result of the collision---is by far the more common\ntype. In this case, the energy of the scattered photon is less than the\nenergy of the incident photon (longer wavelength). The \"missing\" energy\nfrom the incident photon often goes into raising the vibrational energy\nof the scatterer. That is, energy gets transferred from the incident\nphoton to the scatterer, which is initially in a low-energy vibrational\nstate. The scatterer absorbs some of this energy, knocking it up to a\nhigher energy vibrational state (i.e., vibrating at a higher frequency).\nThe downward shift in the energy of the scattered photon with respect to\nthat of the incident photon is called a **Stokes shift**, which just\nmeans that the scattered photon has less energy than the incident\nphoton. You may also see the word **red shift** or the super jargony\nword ***bathochromic* shift**.\n\n#### Vibrational spectroscopy: Infrared and Raman\n\nSometimes, a scatterer is already in a higher (excited) vibrational\nstate, and in the process of collision with the incoming photon, this\nextra energy is transferred to the scattered photon. The scattered\nphoton thus has increased energy (shorter wavelength) compared to the\nenergy of the incident photon. The shift in wavelength of the scattered\nphoton relative to the incident photon is called an **anti-Stokes**\nshift, a **blue shift**, or a ***hypsochromic* shift**. Vibrational\ntransitions, which are are usually in the infrared region of the EM\nspectrum, can be observed directly by infrared absorption\nspectroscopy[^8.2.2] or indirectly upon irradiation with a laser of a\nvisible wavelength, by **Raman spectroscopy**. In this modality, the\nenergy of the vibrational transition is equal to the difference in\nenergy between the incident and scattered light.[^8.2.3]\n\nThe differences in energy between incident and scattered or emitted\nphotons is the basis of the field of **spectroscopy**. It is often\npossible to reveal something about the construction of molecules and the\ncomposition of matter by analyzing the *spectra* produced by\nlight-matter interactions. These spectra can act as fingerprints unique\nto the interaction taking place, and like detectives at the scene of a\ncrime, we can use spectroscopy help identify the matter of interest. We\nwill touch on electronic absorption (ultraviolet-visible) and\nfluorescence spectroscopy in later sections in this chapter.\n\n### 8.2.2. Absorption due to the movement of electrons\n\nAs we hinted in the discussion of scattering, it is common for some or\nall of the energy of an incident photon to be absorbed by the material\nor molecule. We touched on changes in vibrational energy levels that can\noccur upon absorption, but such differences usually take place in the\ninfrared spectrum. For optoelectronic applications (e.g., solar cells\nand display panels), we are often more interested in those that occur in\nthe visible range of the EM spectrum. The molecular basis for visible\nabsorption usually involves promotion of electrons from the **conduction\nband** or **bonding orbitals** to the **valence band** or **antibonding\norbitals**. These transitions are interesting because they can indicate\nchemical activity such as bond breakage or photon-driven charge\nseparation in solar cells. In Figure (8.3), we see a diagram of the band\nenergies for a generic material that absorbs light in the visible region\nof the EM spectrum (i.e., a dye molecule, a semiconductor, or a quantum\ndot).\n\n(Figure 8.3) \n>>>image(orbitals.png.0)\n\nYou might ask why, if the band gap energy has a specific value (say, 2.5\nelectron volts), the absorption spectrum is a broad hump and not a sharp\nvertical line. Indeed, for a completely isolated, single molecule at a\ntemperature of absolute zero, one might obtain a single vertical line.\nThe reason this does not happen in the real world is that the gap\nbetween the valence and conduction bands is a measure of the gap between\nthe **frontiers** or **edges** of these bands. When a molecule is in\nsolution and in van der Waals contact with nearby molecules, the energy\nlevels become blurry. That is, there are many energy states above and\nbelow these levels to and from which electrons can be excited by an\nincoming photon. The function that describes the distribution of energy\nlevels is called the **density of states**. It is this interplay of\nlight and electronic energy levels---combined with the phenomena in\nscattering---that gives rise to the perception of color.\n\n### 8.2.3. Emission: Fluorescence and Phosphorescence\n\nSuppose a molecule absorbs a photon, and an electron that was initially\nin the ground state (say at the valence band edge) gets promoted to a\nhigher energy level (say the conduction band edge). The potential energy\nof the electron is now substantially greater than it was before, and\nthis is an unstable situation. The electron will tend to return to its\nground state, and can do so in a number of ways. For example, it can\ncollide with some other molecules, which take on some of the energy as\ntranslational motion, and the electron eventually makes its way back to\nthe valence band. This process is called **non-radiative\nrecombination**[^8.2.4]. Alternatively, the electron can transfer its energy\nto another molecule, whose electron gets promoted, while the electron of\nthe original molecule returns to its ground state. This type of energy\ntransfer can be mediated by a photon---i.e., emitted by the first\nmolecule and absorbed by the second---or it can occur through space,\nwithout the emission of a photon. When the non-photon process occurs, it\nis called **F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)**, and tends to\noccur when the emission spectrum of the first molecule overlaps with the\nabsorption spectrum of the second. Finally, the excited electron may\ndecay to the ground state by emitting a photon similar, but not usually\nidentical,[^8.2.5] to the band gap in two related processes known as\n*fluorescence* and *phosphorescence*.\n\n#### Photoluminescence I: Fluorescence\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with a black light (i.e., near-visible,\nUV-A light) or pointed one at various objects to see if anything glows,\nthat glowing is a type of **photoluminescence**[^8.2.6] called\n**fluorescence**. In general, fluorescence occurs when high-energy light\nis absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule or material as lower-energy\nlight. To see why this is, consider Figure (8.4) shown below.\n\n(Figure 8.4) \n>>>image(thermalization.png.0)\n\nThe band gap has a specific energy and it is true that photons with\nenergies *below* the band gap do not get absorbed. However, we know that\nphotons with energies *above* than the band gap get absorbed all the\ntime. When an electron gets excited by such a high-energy photon, where\ndoes it go? The answer is that it gets promoted to one of the energy\nlevels above the band edge with a probability based on the **density of\nstates**.[^8.2.7] Once the electron is in this higher-energy state, it\nquickly transitions down to the band edge by releasing its energy into\nthe bulk material (or solution) as heat. This process, known as\n**thermalization**, ensures that the starting point for every\nfluorescent process starts with the electron at the bottom of the\nconduction band. While these electrons may return to the energy level\nexactly at the edge of the valence band, it is more likely that they too\nwill find a band with a lower energy than the band edge. Again, this\nprocess is determined by the density of states, this time below the band\nedge. These processes ensure that the energy of the absorption spectrum\nfor a molecule or material is centered in a range higher than that of\nthe fluorescence spectrum.\n\n#### Photoluminescence II: Phosphorescence\n\nThe day I wrote this sentence, I helped my three-year-old daughter put\nconstellations of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of her bedroom.\nAt first, the glow emitted by glow-in-the-dark stickers, plastic, and\npaint seems like it might be fluorescent. However, fluorescent items\nstop glowing as soon as we turn off the excitation sources, whereas\nglow-in-the-dark materials stay lit for several minutes or even hours.\nThis long-lasting glow is indicative of a process known as\n**phosphorescence**. Phosphorescence occurs when the **spin** of an\nexcited electron changes sign (i.e., from \"up\" to \"down\" or vice versa).\nSuch an electron enters a new manifold of energy states in a process\ncalled **intersystem crossing**. From this new manifold of energy\nstates, the spin of the electron must go back to its original spin in\norder to transition back down to its original ground state. This\ntransition is quantum mechanically \"forbidden.\" It still happens, but\nwith a lower probability and thus it takes a long time. Hence why the\nstars glow long after the lamp is turned off.\n\n### 8.2.4. Perception of color\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to be aware of the limitations of our\nown visual system, and not to believe that we are in possession of a\nperfect \"eyeball spectrometer\" (though it is quite good in many\ncircumstances). In fact, we have three types of color receptive **cone\ncells** in our retinas (unless you have some form of colorblindness).\nOrganisms with these *trichromatic* visual systems have dye molecules in\nthese light-sensitive cells that respond most strongly to red, green,\nand blue light. By mixing different ratios of these colors (see Figure\n(8.5), below), it is possible for an RGB display (like the one you are\nlooking at if you are reading this on a screen) to generate the\nperception of any color by triggering these three different cone cells\nin the right ratios. For example, a lot of red and slightly less green\nwould be perceived as yellow centering around 570 nm. A true yellow\nlight source (like an LED) would excite the same ratios of red and green\ncone cells as the \"fake\" yellow light, and the outcome would be exactly\nthe same: i.e., you would perceive yellow, even though you do not have a\nsingle cone cell that responds to yellow light.\n\n(Figure 8.5) \n>>>image(cone cells.png.0)\n\nThe photons that reach our eyes which are involved in the perception of\ncolor have either been transmitted, scattered, or emitted. If you are\nreading this on a screen, the photons have been emitted by semiconductor\nlight emitting devices behind the colored pixels, through which they are\ntransmitted. If you are reading this on paper, the light that is\nreaching your eyes has been scattered by the white paper and absorbed by\nthe black ink.[^8.2.8] You may remember from elementary school that for an\nobject to appear a certain color, it absorbs every color but the one it\nappears, which is reflected. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but\nit gets the point across, at least for opaque materials. There are\nactually a few ways that an object produces color when illuminated with\nbroad spectrum light (i.e., white light with maybe a little UV in\nthere). The following figure, (8.6), illustrates the possibilities we\nhave discussed in this chapter.\n\n(Figure 8.6) \n>>>image(summary light interaction.png.0)\n\nIn the top row, an object which is transparent to some wavelengths is\nilluminated with white light. The object (or solution of dyes or\nnanoparticles) absorbs a subset of these wavelengths in accordance with\nits band edges and density of states. The light that is not absorbed by\nthe object or solution is **transmitted** through the medium to our\neyeballs. In the second row, white light containing all the visible\nwavelengths impinges upon an absorbing medium. Some wavelengths of the\nlight are scattered. For metallic nanoparticles, absorption and\nscattering typically occur at the wavelength that corresponds to the\n**surface plasmon resonance** of the particle. That is, the wavelength\nthat is in **resonance** with the energy of the oscillating conduction\nelectrons that make up metallic bonds between metal atoms. So,\nscattering and absorption occur at the same wavelengths for these\nparticles. However, for ordinary scenarios involving colored, opaque\nobjects, the perceived color is what is scattered. So, the wavelengths\nof white light that were not absorbed by the surface are scattered and\nvisible to our eyes.\n\nFinally, light can reach our eyes through the process of direct\nemission. For example, from a fluorescent object, a light bulb, a\nglow-in-the-dark star, or even the sun. Remember that even a\nmonochromatic light source, such as a laser, which emits only at a\nsingle wavelength, triggers more than one cone cell in our eyes.\nUltimately, the perception of a color by our brain is the result of a\nsuperposition of signals arising from multiple types of color-sensitive\nnerve endings that are stimulated in a ratio that depends on the\nincoming wavelength. What the brain does with this information is\nwaaaaay outside the scope of this course. But the bottom line is that we\nperceive it as a color.\n\n[^8.2.1]: Quick; fleeting.\n\n[^8.2.2]: Specifically, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\n\n[^8.2.3]: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies yield complementary information\n    about the bonding structure of a molecule. Vibrational modes that\n    are active in FTIR are those corresponding to periodic modulation of\n    the molecule's *dipole moment*, while those active under Raman are\n    those corresponding to the molecule's *polarizability*. The\n    quintessential example of the former is CO$_2$ (the carbon atom\n    vibrating between the oxygen atoms) and that of the latter is N$_2$\n    (the nitrogen atoms getting closer together and farther apart).\n\n[^8.2.4]: Because the electron is \"re-combining\" with the positively charged\n    \"hole\" that it left in the valence band\n\n[^8.2.5]: See next paragraph.\n\n[^8.2.6]: Light emission stimulated by light.\n\n[^8.2.7]: The states are individual energy levels that can be occupied by\n    electrons, of which the state at the band edge or *frontier* is only\n    one!\n\n[^8.2.8]: Though ultimately the source of this white light is a light in the\n    room or the sun, which both generate photons by emission.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Quantum mechanical model for absorption: the particle in a box\nThere are several models one can use to predict the electronic\ntransitions and absorption properties of relatively simple absorbers\nlike organic dyes. The simplest---though it is not simple to any\nfirst-time learner---is the **particle-in-a-box** model. The most common\ntype of particle-in-a-box is an electron in an energy well with\ninfinitely hard side walls. Inside the well, the potential energy is\nzero. Beyond the walls, the potential energy is infinite. Imagine that\nan electron is placed in the well. Remember our discussion of photons as\nboth particles and waves? It turns out that *every* object can be\ntreated as both a particle and a wave. That is, even solid, macroscopic\nobjects have wavelike properties. However, for objects of appreciable\nmass, the wavelength is miniscule and the object can be treated as a\nparticle only. Thus, the wavelike properties of matter typically only\nmanifest for electrons, protons, atoms, and very small molecules.\n\nThe behavior of an electron inside the box can be described by a\n**wavefunction**, which is a solution to the **Schr\u00f6dinger equation**\n\n(Equation 8.2) $$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}=E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$, $m$ is the mass of\nthe particle (the electron in this case), $\\psi(x)$ is the wave\nfunction, $x$ is the horizontal position variable along the box, and\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}$ is the second derivative of the wave function\nwith respect to the position.[^8.3.1] The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an example\nof a **differential equation**, which is a function that is related to\nits own derivative. While there are whole courses in \"diff-eq\" that you\nwill probably take later in your studies, we can get most of the way\nthere just by looking at the equation with the sparest knowledge of\nfirst-semester or AP calculus. The question is, what function has the\nsame form as its second derivative? The answer is sine and cosine\nfunctions! After some guessing and checking, one can come up with the\nfollowing\n\n(Equation 8.3) $$\\psi_n(x)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin{\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}}$$\n\nwhere the index $n$ is an integer $\\geq$ 1. Plugging this solution back\ninto equation (8.2), we get an expression for the energy\n\n(Equation 8.4) $$E_n=\\frac{h^2n^2}{8mL^2}$$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the $n^{th}$ energy level. The shapes of\nthe wave functions and the energies of the electrons occupying these\nstates only have physical meaning in the most contrived, idealized\nscenarios. Nevertheless, wave functions can be obtained for a number of\npotentials, such as spherical ones for atoms.\n\nFigure (8.7) below shows the shapes of the wave functions for $n=1$,\ntermed the **ground state**, $n=2$, termed the **first excited state**,\nand $n=3$, the **second excited state**.[^8.3.2] In these diagrams, the wave\nfunction $\\psi(x)$ is the **probability amplitude**; it shows the shape\nof the wave function, and in particular the phases (i.e., above and\nbelow an imaginary horizontal line separating the \"positive\" and\n\"negative\" regions of the function). The square of this function,\n$|\\psi(x)|^2$, is the **probability density**, which is positive (above\nthe horizontal line) everywhere. That is, the function which shows where\nyou are most likely to find the electron within the box. This function\nintegrates to 1, since that is the probability of finding the electron\nsomewhere in the box.\n\n(Figure 8.7) \n>>>image(energy_levels.png.0)\n\n### 8.3.1. Organic dyes and the color of carrots\n\nThe particle-in-a-box model can first seem very obscure. What it is it\ngood for? It turns out that the particle-in-a-box model is most useful\nin determining energy *differences* between states. Often, what we care\nabout most are the gaps between the valence band and the conduction band\nof a molecule or a solid. In some (idealized) cases, it is even possible\nto get a number that's in the right ballpark of the correct value for a\nphysical system. Consider the structure of $\\beta$-carotene, below\n(Figure (8.8)).\n\n(Figure 8.8) \n>>>image(betacarotene.png.0)\n\n$\\beta$-Carotene is the structure most commonly associated with the\norange color of carrots, though in pure form it is more red than orange.\nThe most striking structural feature of $\\beta$-carotene is its long\nconjugated core (that is, alternating double and single bonds). Such a\nstructure gives rise to absorption in the visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.[^8.3.3] It is actually possible to use the\nparticle-in-a-box model to predict that $\\beta$-carotene absorbs in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. Furthermore, if we are a little loose\nwith some of the parameters, we can get it to appear orange.\n\nTo start out, we need to know the approximate length of the\n$\\pi$-conjugated **chromophore**[^8.3.4] and the number of electrons in it.\nLet's say a good approximation is 18.5 \u00c5. Looking at the structure in\nFigure (8.8), we see that there are 22 carbon atoms involved in the\n$\\pi$ system. From general chemistry, we know that some number of\n**atomic orbitals** give rise to the same number of **molecular\norbitals**. So, we will expect to have 22 total molecular orbitals. An\norbital is a place where electrons live, and it can be defined\nmathematically by a wave function, $\\psi(x)$. As you may also remember,\neach bonding molecular orbital gets two electrons, so the first 11 wave\nfunctions starting with the lowest energy---representing the 11\n**bonding orbitals** of $\\beta$-carotene---are filled, while the top 11\nwave functions---representing the **antibonding orbitals** are empty.\nThe bonding orbitals can be treated as the valence band, and the\nantibonding orbitals can be treated as the conduction band. The **band\ngap** is defined as the difference in energy between the **highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)** (i.e., the valence band edge) and\nthe **lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)** (i.e., the conduction\nband edge). Convince yourself that the difference in energy is given by\nthe following equation:\n\n(Equation 8.5) $$\\Delta E = (n_f^2 - n_i^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ is the initial state and $n_f$ is the final state. When the\nmolecule absorbs a photon, the electron is promoted from $n_i$ to $n_f$.\nIf these two states correspond to the band edges, then $n_i=11$ and\n$n_f=12$. So,\n\n$$\\Delta E = (12^2 - 11^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23 \\times (6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js})^2}{8 (9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})(1.85 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m})^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{490 \\, \\text{nm}}$$\n\n\nThe real bandgap of $\\beta$-carotene is closer to 470 nm, but we should\nbe surprised that this super simple model got as close as it did. After\nall, 18.5 \u00c5 is not quite the length of the $\\pi$ system, however, we\nalso ignored all of the electrostatic effects of the protons, the fact\nthat these molecules are twisting and dancing all over the place, and\nthe fact that the electrons are not truly **delocalized**. That is, in a\nreal molecule---not the fake construct of a box with infinite\nwalls---the electrons are not free to occupy any of the length of the\n\"box\" defined by the $\\pi$ system.\n\n### 8.3.2. Quantum dots\n\nA quantum dot is a clever nickname for a **semiconductor nanocrystal**.\nThe moniker \"dot\" emphasizes the quantization of the energy levels. Just\nlike the particle in a box, a quantum dot has **quantized**---can only\ntake on a predefined set of energies---absorption and emission behavior.\nQuantum dots can be made of any direct-bandgap semiconductor, but are\noften metal chalcogenides, including cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe), and lead sulfide (PbS). However, any small\nsemiconductor particle with quantized energy levels will exhibit\nquantum-dot-like behavior. Small platelets of graphene will even\nqualify: **graphene quantum dots**.\n\nThe energy of absorption and emission in a quantum dot follows the same\nqualitative trend as in the particle-in-a-box model: the smaller the\ndot, the more confined the electron, the larger the bandgap, and thus\nthe bluer (higher energy!) the absorption and emission. It is common to\nsee pretty photographs of fluorescent quantum dots like the drawing in\nFigure (8.9), which emphasizes the relationship between particle size\nand band gap.\n\n(Figure 8.9) \n>>>image(quantum dot.png.0)\n\nThe energy of emission of a quantum dot can be predicted by calculating\nits band gap, as determined by\n\n(Equation 8.6)\n$$E_{QD} = E_{bulk} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2a^2} (\\frac{1}{m_e} + \\frac{1}{m_h}) - \\frac{1.8e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\epsilon_0a}$$\n\nwhere the first term is the energy of the bandgap of the bulk\nsemiconductor (i.e., a block of the material of macroscopic extent), the\nsecond term is due to size confinement (i.e., the particle-in-a-box\nenergy), and the third term is the Coulombic attraction between the\nelectron and the hole. $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$,\nand $a$ is the radius of the quantum dot. The band gap of the quantum\ndot is greater than that of the bulk semiconductor by an amount related\nto the particle-in-a-box energy (notice the similarity of the second\nterm of equation (8.6) to that of equation (8.5)). In this case, $m_e$\nand $m_h$ are the masses of the electron and hole.[^8.3.5] Finally, the\nenergy of the bandgap of the quantum dot is reduced by the (favorable)\nattraction between the electron and hole. In fact, the final term in\nequation (8.6) looks a lot like Coulomb's law, equation (2.1).\n\n[^8.3.1]: Don't get scared if you haven't learned calculus before. The first\n    derivative is the rate of change of a function with respect to the\n    variable in the denominator; the second derivative is the rate of\n    change of this rate of change. The second derivative is analogous to\n    the acceleration being the derivative of the velocity, which itself\n    is the derivative of the displacement with respect to time. So, if\n    the function is the displacement, the first derivative is the\n    velocity, and the second derivative is the acceleration.\n\n[^8.3.2]: Note the naming convention where $n=2$ is somehow the first of\n    something. Even the best of us mess this up at least once in our\n    lives.\n\n[^8.3.3]: It also gives it semiconducting behavior. In fact,\n    $\\beta$-carotene is a p-type semiconductor and can be used to make\n    solar cells and thin-film transistors.\n\n[^8.3.4]: The chromophore is the part of the molecule that makes it colored.\n\n[^8.3.5]: Wait, how can a hole have a mass? Because as the hole moves, an\n    electron backfills the hole, and the electron has mass.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Properties of light\nEverything you see around you is ultimately the result of light waves\ninteracting with molecular structures, nanostructures, and\nsurfaces---i.e., **light-matter interactions**. These light waves engage\nthe matter in various ways, and some of them are conveyed back to you to\ncreate an image on your retina. The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Scattering, absorption, and nothing\nWhen a photon strikes an object, three things can happen:\n**scattering**, **absorption**, and **nothing**. Which of these\neventualities occurs depends on the size, shape, atomic composition, and\nvarious idiosyncracies of the chunk of matter under consideration.\n\n### 8.2.1. Scattering\n\nScattering is the process of absorption and re-emission of a photon in\nrapid succession. In fact, most of the photons that arrive at our\nretinas have been scattered by the objects we perceive in our visual\nfield. Absorption and re-emission occurs by transient[^8.2.1] polarization\nof the electron cloud of the atoms that make up an object; when the\nelectron cloud returns to its unpolarized equilibrium, a photon is\nre-emitted. This re-emitted photon is known as the **scattered photon**.\n\n#### Elastic and inelastic scattering\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is either greater than, less than, or\nequal to the energy of the incident photon. In the case where the\nscattered photon has the same energy as that of the incident photon, the\nscattering process is deemed **elastic** or **Rayleigh** scattering.\nThat is, energy was neither absorbed by the material nor transferred to\nthe photon as a result of the collision. When the energy is greater than\nor less than that of the incident photon, the process is said to be\n**inelastic** or **Raman** scattering. That is, energy is either\nabsorbed by the material or transferred from the material to the photon.\nA schematic diagram of the two scattering processes is shown in Figure\n(8.2).\n\n(Figure 8.2) \n>>>image(scattering.png.0)\n\nInelastic scattering---the type of scattering where energy is absorbed\nby the material as a result of the collision---is by far the more common\ntype. In this case, the energy of the scattered photon is less than the\nenergy of the incident photon (longer wavelength). The \"missing\" energy\nfrom the incident photon often goes into raising the vibrational energy\nof the scatterer. That is, energy gets transferred from the incident\nphoton to the scatterer, which is initially in a low-energy vibrational\nstate. The scatterer absorbs some of this energy, knocking it up to a\nhigher energy vibrational state (i.e., vibrating at a higher frequency).\nThe downward shift in the energy of the scattered photon with respect to\nthat of the incident photon is called a **Stokes shift**, which just\nmeans that the scattered photon has less energy than the incident\nphoton. You may also see the word **red shift** or the super jargony\nword ***bathochromic* shift**.\n\n#### Vibrational spectroscopy: Infrared and Raman\n\nSometimes, a scatterer is already in a higher (excited) vibrational\nstate, and in the process of collision with the incoming photon, this\nextra energy is transferred to the scattered photon. The scattered\nphoton thus has increased energy (shorter wavelength) compared to the\nenergy of the incident photon. The shift in wavelength of the scattered\nphoton relative to the incident photon is called an **anti-Stokes**\nshift, a **blue shift**, or a ***hypsochromic* shift**. Vibrational\ntransitions, which are are usually in the infrared region of the EM\nspectrum, can be observed directly by infrared absorption\nspectroscopy[^8.2.2] or indirectly upon irradiation with a laser of a\nvisible wavelength, by **Raman spectroscopy**. In this modality, the\nenergy of the vibrational transition is equal to the difference in\nenergy between the incident and scattered light.[^8.2.3]\n\nThe differences in energy between incident and scattered or emitted\nphotons is the basis of the field of **spectroscopy**. It is often\npossible to reveal something about the construction of molecules and the\ncomposition of matter by analyzing the *spectra* produced by\nlight-matter interactions. These spectra can act as fingerprints unique\nto the interaction taking place, and like detectives at the scene of a\ncrime, we can use spectroscopy help identify the matter of interest. We\nwill touch on electronic absorption (ultraviolet-visible) and\nfluorescence spectroscopy in later sections in this chapter.\n\n### 8.2.2. Absorption due to the movement of electrons\n\nAs we hinted in the discussion of scattering, it is common for some or\nall of the energy of an incident photon to be absorbed by the material\nor molecule. We touched on changes in vibrational energy levels that can\noccur upon absorption, but such differences usually take place in the\ninfrared spectrum. For optoelectronic applications (e.g., solar cells\nand display panels), we are often more interested in those that occur in\nthe visible range of the EM spectrum. The molecular basis for visible\nabsorption usually involves promotion of electrons from the **conduction\nband** or **bonding orbitals** to the **valence band** or **antibonding\norbitals**. These transitions are interesting because they can indicate\nchemical activity such as bond breakage or photon-driven charge\nseparation in solar cells. In Figure (8.3), we see a diagram of the band\nenergies for a generic material that absorbs light in the visible region\nof the EM spectrum (i.e., a dye molecule, a semiconductor, or a quantum\ndot).\n\n(Figure 8.3) \n>>>image(orbitals.png.0)\n\nYou might ask why, if the band gap energy has a specific value (say, 2.5\nelectron volts), the absorption spectrum is a broad hump and not a sharp\nvertical line. Indeed, for a completely isolated, single molecule at a\ntemperature of absolute zero, one might obtain a single vertical line.\nThe reason this does not happen in the real world is that the gap\nbetween the valence and conduction bands is a measure of the gap between\nthe **frontiers** or **edges** of these bands. When a molecule is in\nsolution and in van der Waals contact with nearby molecules, the energy\nlevels become blurry. That is, there are many energy states above and\nbelow these levels to and from which electrons can be excited by an\nincoming photon. The function that describes the distribution of energy\nlevels is called the **density of states**. It is this interplay of\nlight and electronic energy levels---combined with the phenomena in\nscattering---that gives rise to the perception of color.\n\n### 8.2.3. Emission: Fluorescence and Phosphorescence\n\nSuppose a molecule absorbs a photon, and an electron that was initially\nin the ground state (say at the valence band edge) gets promoted to a\nhigher energy level (say the conduction band edge). The potential energy\nof the electron is now substantially greater than it was before, and\nthis is an unstable situation. The electron will tend to return to its\nground state, and can do so in a number of ways. For example, it can\ncollide with some other molecules, which take on some of the energy as\ntranslational motion, and the electron eventually makes its way back to\nthe valence band. This process is called **non-radiative\nrecombination**[^8.2.4]. Alternatively, the electron can transfer its energy\nto another molecule, whose electron gets promoted, while the electron of\nthe original molecule returns to its ground state. This type of energy\ntransfer can be mediated by a photon---i.e., emitted by the first\nmolecule and absorbed by the second---or it can occur through space,\nwithout the emission of a photon. When the non-photon process occurs, it\nis called **F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)**, and tends to\noccur when the emission spectrum of the first molecule overlaps with the\nabsorption spectrum of the second. Finally, the excited electron may\ndecay to the ground state by emitting a photon similar, but not usually\nidentical,[^8.2.5] to the band gap in two related processes known as\n*fluorescence* and *phosphorescence*.\n\n#### Photoluminescence I: Fluorescence\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with a black light (i.e., near-visible,\nUV-A light) or pointed one at various objects to see if anything glows,\nthat glowing is a type of **photoluminescence**[^8.2.6] called\n**fluorescence**. In general, fluorescence occurs when high-energy light\nis absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule or material as lower-energy\nlight. To see why this is, consider Figure (8.4) shown below.\n\n(Figure 8.4) \n>>>image(thermalization.png.0)\n\nThe band gap has a specific energy and it is true that photons with\nenergies *below* the band gap do not get absorbed. However, we know that\nphotons with energies *above* than the band gap get absorbed all the\ntime. When an electron gets excited by such a high-energy photon, where\ndoes it go? The answer is that it gets promoted to one of the energy\nlevels above the band edge with a probability based on the **density of\nstates**.[^8.2.7] Once the electron is in this higher-energy state, it\nquickly transitions down to the band edge by releasing its energy into\nthe bulk material (or solution) as heat. This process, known as\n**thermalization**, ensures that the starting point for every\nfluorescent process starts with the electron at the bottom of the\nconduction band. While these electrons may return to the energy level\nexactly at the edge of the valence band, it is more likely that they too\nwill find a band with a lower energy than the band edge. Again, this\nprocess is determined by the density of states, this time below the band\nedge. These processes ensure that the energy of the absorption spectrum\nfor a molecule or material is centered in a range higher than that of\nthe fluorescence spectrum.\n\n#### Photoluminescence II: Phosphorescence\n\nThe day I wrote this sentence, I helped my three-year-old daughter put\nconstellations of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of her bedroom.\nAt first, the glow emitted by glow-in-the-dark stickers, plastic, and\npaint seems like it might be fluorescent. However, fluorescent items\nstop glowing as soon as we turn off the excitation sources, whereas\nglow-in-the-dark materials stay lit for several minutes or even hours.\nThis long-lasting glow is indicative of a process known as\n**phosphorescence**. Phosphorescence occurs when the **spin** of an\nexcited electron changes sign (i.e., from \"up\" to \"down\" or vice versa).\nSuch an electron enters a new manifold of energy states in a process\ncalled **intersystem crossing**. From this new manifold of energy\nstates, the spin of the electron must go back to its original spin in\norder to transition back down to its original ground state. This\ntransition is quantum mechanically \"forbidden.\" It still happens, but\nwith a lower probability and thus it takes a long time. Hence why the\nstars glow long after the lamp is turned off.\n\n### 8.2.4. Perception of color\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to be aware of the limitations of our\nown visual system, and not to believe that we are in possession of a\nperfect \"eyeball spectrometer\" (though it is quite good in many\ncircumstances). In fact, we have three types of color receptive **cone\ncells** in our retinas (unless you have some form of colorblindness).\nOrganisms with these *trichromatic* visual systems have dye molecules in\nthese light-sensitive cells that respond most strongly to red, green,\nand blue light. By mixing different ratios of these colors (see Figure\n(8.5), below), it is possible for an RGB display (like the one you are\nlooking at if you are reading this on a screen) to generate the\nperception of any color by triggering these three different cone cells\nin the right ratios. For example, a lot of red and slightly less green\nwould be perceived as yellow centering around 570 nm. A true yellow\nlight source (like an LED) would excite the same ratios of red and green\ncone cells as the \"fake\" yellow light, and the outcome would be exactly\nthe same: i.e., you would perceive yellow, even though you do not have a\nsingle cone cell that responds to yellow light.\n\n(Figure 8.5) \n>>>image(cone cells.png.0)\n\nThe photons that reach our eyes which are involved in the perception of\ncolor have either been transmitted, scattered, or emitted. If you are\nreading this on a screen, the photons have been emitted by semiconductor\nlight emitting devices behind the colored pixels, through which they are\ntransmitted. If you are reading this on paper, the light that is\nreaching your eyes has been scattered by the white paper and absorbed by\nthe black ink.[^8.2.8] You may remember from elementary school that for an\nobject to appear a certain color, it absorbs every color but the one it\nappears, which is reflected. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but\nit gets the point across, at least for opaque materials. There are\nactually a few ways that an object produces color when illuminated with\nbroad spectrum light (i.e., white light with maybe a little UV in\nthere). The following figure, (8.6), illustrates the possibilities we\nhave discussed in this chapter.\n\n(Figure 8.6) \n>>>image(summary light interaction.png.0)\n\nIn the top row, an object which is transparent to some wavelengths is\nilluminated with white light. The object (or solution of dyes or\nnanoparticles) absorbs a subset of these wavelengths in accordance with\nits band edges and density of states. The light that is not absorbed by\nthe object or solution is **transmitted** through the medium to our\neyeballs. In the second row, white light containing all the visible\nwavelengths impinges upon an absorbing medium. Some wavelengths of the\nlight are scattered. For metallic nanoparticles, absorption and\nscattering typically occur at the wavelength that corresponds to the\n**surface plasmon resonance** of the particle. That is, the wavelength\nthat is in **resonance** with the energy of the oscillating conduction\nelectrons that make up metallic bonds between metal atoms. So,\nscattering and absorption occur at the same wavelengths for these\nparticles. However, for ordinary scenarios involving colored, opaque\nobjects, the perceived color is what is scattered. So, the wavelengths\nof white light that were not absorbed by the surface are scattered and\nvisible to our eyes.\n\nFinally, light can reach our eyes through the process of direct\nemission. For example, from a fluorescent object, a light bulb, a\nglow-in-the-dark star, or even the sun. Remember that even a\nmonochromatic light source, such as a laser, which emits only at a\nsingle wavelength, triggers more than one cone cell in our eyes.\nUltimately, the perception of a color by our brain is the result of a\nsuperposition of signals arising from multiple types of color-sensitive\nnerve endings that are stimulated in a ratio that depends on the\nincoming wavelength. What the brain does with this information is\nwaaaaay outside the scope of this course. But the bottom line is that we\nperceive it as a color.\n\n[^8.2.1]: Quick; fleeting.\n\n[^8.2.2]: Specifically, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\n\n[^8.2.3]: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies yield complementary information\n    about the bonding structure of a molecule. Vibrational modes that\n    are active in FTIR are those corresponding to periodic modulation of\n    the molecule's *dipole moment*, while those active under Raman are\n    those corresponding to the molecule's *polarizability*. The\n    quintessential example of the former is CO$_2$ (the carbon atom\n    vibrating between the oxygen atoms) and that of the latter is N$_2$\n    (the nitrogen atoms getting closer together and farther apart).\n\n[^8.2.4]: Because the electron is \"re-combining\" with the positively charged\n    \"hole\" that it left in the valence band\n\n[^8.2.5]: See next paragraph.\n\n[^8.2.6]: Light emission stimulated by light.\n\n[^8.2.7]: The states are individual energy levels that can be occupied by\n    electrons, of which the state at the band edge or *frontier* is only\n    one!\n\n[^8.2.8]: Though ultimately the source of this white light is a light in the\n    room or the sun, which both generate photons by emission.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Quantum mechanical model for absorption: the particle in a box\nThere are several models one can use to predict the electronic\ntransitions and absorption properties of relatively simple absorbers\nlike organic dyes. The simplest---though it is not simple to any\nfirst-time learner---is the **particle-in-a-box** model. The most common\ntype of particle-in-a-box is an electron in an energy well with\ninfinitely hard side walls. Inside the well, the potential energy is\nzero. Beyond the walls, the potential energy is infinite. Imagine that\nan electron is placed in the well. Remember our discussion of photons as\nboth particles and waves? It turns out that *every* object can be\ntreated as both a particle and a wave. That is, even solid, macroscopic\nobjects have wavelike properties. However, for objects of appreciable\nmass, the wavelength is miniscule and the object can be treated as a\nparticle only. Thus, the wavelike properties of matter typically only\nmanifest for electrons, protons, atoms, and very small molecules.\n\nThe behavior of an electron inside the box can be described by a\n**wavefunction**, which is a solution to the **Schr\u00f6dinger equation**\n\n(Equation 8.2) $$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}=E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$, $m$ is the mass of\nthe particle (the electron in this case), $\\psi(x)$ is the wave\nfunction, $x$ is the horizontal position variable along the box, and\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}$ is the second derivative of the wave function\nwith respect to the position.[^8.3.1] The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an example\nof a **differential equation**, which is a function that is related to\nits own derivative. While there are whole courses in \"diff-eq\" that you\nwill probably take later in your studies, we can get most of the way\nthere just by looking at the equation with the sparest knowledge of\nfirst-semester or AP calculus. The question is, what function has the\nsame form as its second derivative? The answer is sine and cosine\nfunctions! After some guessing and checking, one can come up with the\nfollowing\n\n(Equation 8.3) $$\\psi_n(x)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin{\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}}$$\n\nwhere the index $n$ is an integer $\\geq$ 1. Plugging this solution back\ninto equation (8.2), we get an expression for the energy\n\n(Equation 8.4) $$E_n=\\frac{h^2n^2}{8mL^2}$$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the $n^{th}$ energy level. The shapes of\nthe wave functions and the energies of the electrons occupying these\nstates only have physical meaning in the most contrived, idealized\nscenarios. Nevertheless, wave functions can be obtained for a number of\npotentials, such as spherical ones for atoms.\n\nFigure (8.7) below shows the shapes of the wave functions for $n=1$,\ntermed the **ground state**, $n=2$, termed the **first excited state**,\nand $n=3$, the **second excited state**.[^8.3.2] In these diagrams, the wave\nfunction $\\psi(x)$ is the **probability amplitude**; it shows the shape\nof the wave function, and in particular the phases (i.e., above and\nbelow an imaginary horizontal line separating the \"positive\" and\n\"negative\" regions of the function). The square of this function,\n$|\\psi(x)|^2$, is the **probability density**, which is positive (above\nthe horizontal line) everywhere. That is, the function which shows where\nyou are most likely to find the electron within the box. This function\nintegrates to 1, since that is the probability of finding the electron\nsomewhere in the box.\n\n(Figure 8.7) \n>>>image(energy_levels.png.0)\n\n### 8.3.1. Organic dyes and the color of carrots\n\nThe particle-in-a-box model can first seem very obscure. What it is it\ngood for? It turns out that the particle-in-a-box model is most useful\nin determining energy *differences* between states. Often, what we care\nabout most are the gaps between the valence band and the conduction band\nof a molecule or a solid. In some (idealized) cases, it is even possible\nto get a number that's in the right ballpark of the correct value for a\nphysical system. Consider the structure of $\\beta$-carotene, below\n(Figure (8.8)).\n\n(Figure 8.8) \n>>>image(betacarotene.png.0)\n\n$\\beta$-Carotene is the structure most commonly associated with the\norange color of carrots, though in pure form it is more red than orange.\nThe most striking structural feature of $\\beta$-carotene is its long\nconjugated core (that is, alternating double and single bonds). Such a\nstructure gives rise to absorption in the visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.[^8.3.3] It is actually possible to use the\nparticle-in-a-box model to predict that $\\beta$-carotene absorbs in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. Furthermore, if we are a little loose\nwith some of the parameters, we can get it to appear orange.\n\nTo start out, we need to know the approximate length of the\n$\\pi$-conjugated **chromophore**[^8.3.4] and the number of electrons in it.\nLet's say a good approximation is 18.5 \u00c5. Looking at the structure in\nFigure (8.8), we see that there are 22 carbon atoms involved in the\n$\\pi$ system. From general chemistry, we know that some number of\n**atomic orbitals** give rise to the same number of **molecular\norbitals**. So, we will expect to have 22 total molecular orbitals. An\norbital is a place where electrons live, and it can be defined\nmathematically by a wave function, $\\psi(x)$. As you may also remember,\neach bonding molecular orbital gets two electrons, so the first 11 wave\nfunctions starting with the lowest energy---representing the 11\n**bonding orbitals** of $\\beta$-carotene---are filled, while the top 11\nwave functions---representing the **antibonding orbitals** are empty.\nThe bonding orbitals can be treated as the valence band, and the\nantibonding orbitals can be treated as the conduction band. The **band\ngap** is defined as the difference in energy between the **highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)** (i.e., the valence band edge) and\nthe **lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)** (i.e., the conduction\nband edge). Convince yourself that the difference in energy is given by\nthe following equation:\n\n(Equation 8.5) $$\\Delta E = (n_f^2 - n_i^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ is the initial state and $n_f$ is the final state. When the\nmolecule absorbs a photon, the electron is promoted from $n_i$ to $n_f$.\nIf these two states correspond to the band edges, then $n_i=11$ and\n$n_f=12$. So,\n\n$$\\Delta E = (12^2 - 11^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23 \\times (6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js})^2}{8 (9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})(1.85 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m})^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{490 \\, \\text{nm}}$$\n\n\nThe real bandgap of $\\beta$-carotene is closer to 470 nm, but we should\nbe surprised that this super simple model got as close as it did. After\nall, 18.5 \u00c5 is not quite the length of the $\\pi$ system, however, we\nalso ignored all of the electrostatic effects of the protons, the fact\nthat these molecules are twisting and dancing all over the place, and\nthe fact that the electrons are not truly **delocalized**. That is, in a\nreal molecule---not the fake construct of a box with infinite\nwalls---the electrons are not free to occupy any of the length of the\n\"box\" defined by the $\\pi$ system.\n\n### 8.3.2. Quantum dots\n\nA quantum dot is a clever nickname for a **semiconductor nanocrystal**.\nThe moniker \"dot\" emphasizes the quantization of the energy levels. Just\nlike the particle in a box, a quantum dot has **quantized**---can only\ntake on a predefined set of energies---absorption and emission behavior.\nQuantum dots can be made of any direct-bandgap semiconductor, but are\noften metal chalcogenides, including cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe), and lead sulfide (PbS). However, any small\nsemiconductor particle with quantized energy levels will exhibit\nquantum-dot-like behavior. Small platelets of graphene will even\nqualify: **graphene quantum dots**.\n\nThe energy of absorption and emission in a quantum dot follows the same\nqualitative trend as in the particle-in-a-box model: the smaller the\ndot, the more confined the electron, the larger the bandgap, and thus\nthe bluer (higher energy!) the absorption and emission. It is common to\nsee pretty photographs of fluorescent quantum dots like the drawing in\nFigure (8.9), which emphasizes the relationship between particle size\nand band gap.\n\n(Figure 8.9) \n>>>image(quantum dot.png.0)\n\nThe energy of emission of a quantum dot can be predicted by calculating\nits band gap, as determined by\n\n(Equation 8.6)\n$$E_{QD} = E_{bulk} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2a^2} (\\frac{1}{m_e} + \\frac{1}{m_h}) - \\frac{1.8e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\epsilon_0a}$$\n\nwhere the first term is the energy of the bandgap of the bulk\nsemiconductor (i.e., a block of the material of macroscopic extent), the\nsecond term is due to size confinement (i.e., the particle-in-a-box\nenergy), and the third term is the Coulombic attraction between the\nelectron and the hole. $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$,\nand $a$ is the radius of the quantum dot. The band gap of the quantum\ndot is greater than that of the bulk semiconductor by an amount related\nto the particle-in-a-box energy (notice the similarity of the second\nterm of equation (8.6) to that of equation (8.5)). In this case, $m_e$\nand $m_h$ are the masses of the electron and hole.[^8.3.5] Finally, the\nenergy of the bandgap of the quantum dot is reduced by the (favorable)\nattraction between the electron and hole. In fact, the final term in\nequation (8.6) looks a lot like Coulomb's law, equation (2.1).\n\n[^8.3.1]: Don't get scared if you haven't learned calculus before. The first\n    derivative is the rate of change of a function with respect to the\n    variable in the denominator; the second derivative is the rate of\n    change of this rate of change. The second derivative is analogous to\n    the acceleration being the derivative of the velocity, which itself\n    is the derivative of the displacement with respect to time. So, if\n    the function is the displacement, the first derivative is the\n    velocity, and the second derivative is the acceleration.\n\n[^8.3.2]: Note the naming convention where $n=2$ is somehow the first of\n    something. Even the best of us mess this up at least once in our\n    lives.\n\n[^8.3.3]: It also gives it semiconducting behavior. In fact,\n    $\\beta$-carotene is a p-type semiconductor and can be used to make\n    solar cells and thin-film transistors.\n\n[^8.3.4]: The chromophore is the part of the molecule that makes it colored.\n\n[^8.3.5]: Wait, how can a hole have a mass? Because as the hole moves, an\n    electron backfills the hole, and the electron has mass.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 1: Properties of light\nEverything you see around you is ultimately the result of light waves\ninteracting with molecular structures, nanostructures, and\nsurfaces---i.e., **light-matter interactions**. These light waves engage\nthe matter in various ways, and some of them are conveyed back to you to\ncreate an image on your retina. The way that light waves interact with\natoms and molecules, and then travel to reach your retina, involves\nseveral different processes. Since visible light occupies the range of\nwavelengths from around 400-700 nm, these processes are by definition\nmediated on the nanoscale. Thus, the atomic and molecular structure,\nalong with the nanoscale geometry of matter, determine what happens when\na **photon** of light strikes the object.[^8.1.1] For example, the photon\nmay be absorbed and its energy could be transferred to an electron. In\nanother scenario, the photon may cause the conduction electrons in a\nsolid to be briefly polarized and then return to equilibrium by\nre-emitting a photon. Alternatively, nothing may happen. These\ninteractions between light and matter are responsible for much of our\nobserved, day-to-day experience. Moreover, they also enable myriad\napplications, from solar cells to displays, which will be discussed in\nthe next chapter. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/0mnYMJQko-0)\n\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of propagating, oscillating\n**electric** and **magnetic fields** oriented 90 $^{\\circ}$ to each\nother. The **electromagnetic spectrum**, Figure (8.1), is a linear range\nof energies, which are often expressed in terms of either frequency or\nwavelength, through the following relationships, expressed in equation\n[\\[fig:EM spectrum\\]](#fig:EM spectrum){reference-type=\"eqref\"\nreference=\"fig:EM spectrum\"}.\n\n(Figure 8.1) \n>>>image(EM spectrum.png.0)\n\n(Equation 8.1) $$E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nHere, $E$ is the energy, expressed in joules (J) or electron volts\n(eV),[^8.1.2] $h$ is Planck's constant\n(6.626$\\times10^{-34}\\text{ J s or J per Hz}$, $\\nu$ is the frequency in\nHz (s$^{-1}$), $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is\nthe wavelength.\n\n### 8.1.1. Wave-particle duality\n\nElectromagnetic waves have properties of both waves and particles. For\nexample, light diffracts like a wave, meaning that it bends around\ncorners and interferes with itself when passing through slits. However,\nit also reflects off of objects like the way that billiard balls bounce\noff of objects. Moreover, light is made of up small, quantized bits of\nenergy. These single particles of light are called **photons**[^8.1.3]\nWave-particle duality emerges when considering the fact that single\nphotons can also interfere with themselves. This property was\ndemonstrated using a now classic setup called **Young's double-slit\nexperiment**. When shining a light through two closely spaced slits\n(openings) to a projection screen, one obtains a diffraction pattern of\nmany minima and maxima in light intensity.[^8.1.4] Later, it was determined\nthat the same pattern is obtained even when the source only emits a\nsingle photon at a time (which produces a single blip on the screen or\ndetector) if the photon counts are all added up after the experiment\nruns for a while. So, a single photon is passing through the slits,\ninterfering with itself, and yet producing a single spot on the\ndetector! Diffraction is also the basis of **X-ray crystallography**,\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.\n\n### 8.1.2. Types of EM radiation\n\nVisible light comprises only a small region of the EM spectrum, from\n400-700 nm. Smaller wavelengths---higher energies---are ultraviolet,\nthen X-rays, then gamma ($\\gamma$) rays. Larger wavelengths---lower\nenergies---are infrared (IR), then microwaves, then radio waves (Figure\n(8.1)). Each range of wavelengths interacts with matter at a different\nscale. For example, gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions.\nX-rays are associated with nuclear reactions and the differences in\nenergy between electrons at the surface of an atom and those at the\ncore. Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electrons involved in bonds\nextending across a few atoms, while visible light is absorbed by\nelectrons delocalized across many atoms. IR radiation can excite\nvibrational and rotational motions in molecules, while microwaves can\nexcite motion in molecules having permanent dipoles. Radio waves\ninteract with larger (centimeter to meter scale) metallic structures.\nThe use of EM radiation to probe aspects of the structure of\nmatter---i.e., **spectroscopy**---is covered in Chapter 14.\n\n[^8.1.1]: A photon is the smallest indivisible particle of light\n\n[^8.1.2]: An electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron\n    being accelerated by a potential difference of 1 volt.\n\n[^8.1.3]: Also referred to as \"corpuscles\" of light, another great science\n    word.\n\n[^8.1.4]: You can even do this at your desk by taking several pieces of\n    mechanical pencil lead between your fingertips and keeping them\n    spread out somewhat. Then, take a laser pointer and aim it at a wall\n    with the pencil leads in between. Play with the spacing by rolling\n    the leads in your fingertips until you get a diffraction pattern on\n    the wall. You may have to dim the lights.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 2: Scattering, absorption, and nothing\nWhen a photon strikes an object, three things can happen:\n**scattering**, **absorption**, and **nothing**. Which of these\neventualities occurs depends on the size, shape, atomic composition, and\nvarious idiosyncracies of the chunk of matter under consideration.\n\n### 8.2.1. Scattering\n\nScattering is the process of absorption and re-emission of a photon in\nrapid succession. In fact, most of the photons that arrive at our\nretinas have been scattered by the objects we perceive in our visual\nfield. Absorption and re-emission occurs by transient[^8.2.1] polarization\nof the electron cloud of the atoms that make up an object; when the\nelectron cloud returns to its unpolarized equilibrium, a photon is\nre-emitted. This re-emitted photon is known as the **scattered photon**.\n\n#### Elastic and inelastic scattering\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is either greater than, less than, or\nequal to the energy of the incident photon. In the case where the\nscattered photon has the same energy as that of the incident photon, the\nscattering process is deemed **elastic** or **Rayleigh** scattering.\nThat is, energy was neither absorbed by the material nor transferred to\nthe photon as a result of the collision. When the energy is greater than\nor less than that of the incident photon, the process is said to be\n**inelastic** or **Raman** scattering. That is, energy is either\nabsorbed by the material or transferred from the material to the photon.\nA schematic diagram of the two scattering processes is shown in Figure\n(8.2).\n\n(Figure 8.2) \n>>>image(scattering.png.0)\n\nInelastic scattering---the type of scattering where energy is absorbed\nby the material as a result of the collision---is by far the more common\ntype. In this case, the energy of the scattered photon is less than the\nenergy of the incident photon (longer wavelength). The \"missing\" energy\nfrom the incident photon often goes into raising the vibrational energy\nof the scatterer. That is, energy gets transferred from the incident\nphoton to the scatterer, which is initially in a low-energy vibrational\nstate. The scatterer absorbs some of this energy, knocking it up to a\nhigher energy vibrational state (i.e., vibrating at a higher frequency).\nThe downward shift in the energy of the scattered photon with respect to\nthat of the incident photon is called a **Stokes shift**, which just\nmeans that the scattered photon has less energy than the incident\nphoton. You may also see the word **red shift** or the super jargony\nword ***bathochromic* shift**.\n\n#### Vibrational spectroscopy: Infrared and Raman\n\nSometimes, a scatterer is already in a higher (excited) vibrational\nstate, and in the process of collision with the incoming photon, this\nextra energy is transferred to the scattered photon. The scattered\nphoton thus has increased energy (shorter wavelength) compared to the\nenergy of the incident photon. The shift in wavelength of the scattered\nphoton relative to the incident photon is called an **anti-Stokes**\nshift, a **blue shift**, or a ***hypsochromic* shift**. Vibrational\ntransitions, which are are usually in the infrared region of the EM\nspectrum, can be observed directly by infrared absorption\nspectroscopy[^8.2.2] or indirectly upon irradiation with a laser of a\nvisible wavelength, by **Raman spectroscopy**. In this modality, the\nenergy of the vibrational transition is equal to the difference in\nenergy between the incident and scattered light.[^8.2.3]\n\nThe differences in energy between incident and scattered or emitted\nphotons is the basis of the field of **spectroscopy**. It is often\npossible to reveal something about the construction of molecules and the\ncomposition of matter by analyzing the *spectra* produced by\nlight-matter interactions. These spectra can act as fingerprints unique\nto the interaction taking place, and like detectives at the scene of a\ncrime, we can use spectroscopy help identify the matter of interest. We\nwill touch on electronic absorption (ultraviolet-visible) and\nfluorescence spectroscopy in later sections in this chapter.\n\n### 8.2.2. Absorption due to the movement of electrons\n\nAs we hinted in the discussion of scattering, it is common for some or\nall of the energy of an incident photon to be absorbed by the material\nor molecule. We touched on changes in vibrational energy levels that can\noccur upon absorption, but such differences usually take place in the\ninfrared spectrum. For optoelectronic applications (e.g., solar cells\nand display panels), we are often more interested in those that occur in\nthe visible range of the EM spectrum. The molecular basis for visible\nabsorption usually involves promotion of electrons from the **conduction\nband** or **bonding orbitals** to the **valence band** or **antibonding\norbitals**. These transitions are interesting because they can indicate\nchemical activity such as bond breakage or photon-driven charge\nseparation in solar cells. In Figure (8.3), we see a diagram of the band\nenergies for a generic material that absorbs light in the visible region\nof the EM spectrum (i.e., a dye molecule, a semiconductor, or a quantum\ndot).\n\n(Figure 8.3) \n>>>image(orbitals.png.0)\n\nYou might ask why, if the band gap energy has a specific value (say, 2.5\nelectron volts), the absorption spectrum is a broad hump and not a sharp\nvertical line. Indeed, for a completely isolated, single molecule at a\ntemperature of absolute zero, one might obtain a single vertical line.\nThe reason this does not happen in the real world is that the gap\nbetween the valence and conduction bands is a measure of the gap between\nthe **frontiers** or **edges** of these bands. When a molecule is in\nsolution and in van der Waals contact with nearby molecules, the energy\nlevels become blurry. That is, there are many energy states above and\nbelow these levels to and from which electrons can be excited by an\nincoming photon. The function that describes the distribution of energy\nlevels is called the **density of states**. It is this interplay of\nlight and electronic energy levels---combined with the phenomena in\nscattering---that gives rise to the perception of color.\n\n### 8.2.3. Emission: Fluorescence and Phosphorescence\n\nSuppose a molecule absorbs a photon, and an electron that was initially\nin the ground state (say at the valence band edge) gets promoted to a\nhigher energy level (say the conduction band edge). The potential energy\nof the electron is now substantially greater than it was before, and\nthis is an unstable situation. The electron will tend to return to its\nground state, and can do so in a number of ways. For example, it can\ncollide with some other molecules, which take on some of the energy as\ntranslational motion, and the electron eventually makes its way back to\nthe valence band. This process is called **non-radiative\nrecombination**[^8.2.4]. Alternatively, the electron can transfer its energy\nto another molecule, whose electron gets promoted, while the electron of\nthe original molecule returns to its ground state. This type of energy\ntransfer can be mediated by a photon---i.e., emitted by the first\nmolecule and absorbed by the second---or it can occur through space,\nwithout the emission of a photon. When the non-photon process occurs, it\nis called **F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)**, and tends to\noccur when the emission spectrum of the first molecule overlaps with the\nabsorption spectrum of the second. Finally, the excited electron may\ndecay to the ground state by emitting a photon similar, but not usually\nidentical,[^8.2.5] to the band gap in two related processes known as\n*fluorescence* and *phosphorescence*.\n\n#### Photoluminescence I: Fluorescence\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with a black light (i.e., near-visible,\nUV-A light) or pointed one at various objects to see if anything glows,\nthat glowing is a type of **photoluminescence**[^8.2.6] called\n**fluorescence**. In general, fluorescence occurs when high-energy light\nis absorbed and re-emitted by a molecule or material as lower-energy\nlight. To see why this is, consider Figure (8.4) shown below.\n\n(Figure 8.4) \n>>>image(thermalization.png.0)\n\nThe band gap has a specific energy and it is true that photons with\nenergies *below* the band gap do not get absorbed. However, we know that\nphotons with energies *above* than the band gap get absorbed all the\ntime. When an electron gets excited by such a high-energy photon, where\ndoes it go? The answer is that it gets promoted to one of the energy\nlevels above the band edge with a probability based on the **density of\nstates**.[^8.2.7] Once the electron is in this higher-energy state, it\nquickly transitions down to the band edge by releasing its energy into\nthe bulk material (or solution) as heat. This process, known as\n**thermalization**, ensures that the starting point for every\nfluorescent process starts with the electron at the bottom of the\nconduction band. While these electrons may return to the energy level\nexactly at the edge of the valence band, it is more likely that they too\nwill find a band with a lower energy than the band edge. Again, this\nprocess is determined by the density of states, this time below the band\nedge. These processes ensure that the energy of the absorption spectrum\nfor a molecule or material is centered in a range higher than that of\nthe fluorescence spectrum.\n\n#### Photoluminescence II: Phosphorescence\n\nThe day I wrote this sentence, I helped my three-year-old daughter put\nconstellations of glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of her bedroom.\nAt first, the glow emitted by glow-in-the-dark stickers, plastic, and\npaint seems like it might be fluorescent. However, fluorescent items\nstop glowing as soon as we turn off the excitation sources, whereas\nglow-in-the-dark materials stay lit for several minutes or even hours.\nThis long-lasting glow is indicative of a process known as\n**phosphorescence**. Phosphorescence occurs when the **spin** of an\nexcited electron changes sign (i.e., from \"up\" to \"down\" or vice versa).\nSuch an electron enters a new manifold of energy states in a process\ncalled **intersystem crossing**. From this new manifold of energy\nstates, the spin of the electron must go back to its original spin in\norder to transition back down to its original ground state. This\ntransition is quantum mechanically \"forbidden.\" It still happens, but\nwith a lower probability and thus it takes a long time. Hence why the\nstars glow long after the lamp is turned off.\n\n### 8.2.4. Perception of color\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to be aware of the limitations of our\nown visual system, and not to believe that we are in possession of a\nperfect \"eyeball spectrometer\" (though it is quite good in many\ncircumstances). In fact, we have three types of color receptive **cone\ncells** in our retinas (unless you have some form of colorblindness).\nOrganisms with these *trichromatic* visual systems have dye molecules in\nthese light-sensitive cells that respond most strongly to red, green,\nand blue light. By mixing different ratios of these colors (see Figure\n(8.5), below), it is possible for an RGB display (like the one you are\nlooking at if you are reading this on a screen) to generate the\nperception of any color by triggering these three different cone cells\nin the right ratios. For example, a lot of red and slightly less green\nwould be perceived as yellow centering around 570 nm. A true yellow\nlight source (like an LED) would excite the same ratios of red and green\ncone cells as the \"fake\" yellow light, and the outcome would be exactly\nthe same: i.e., you would perceive yellow, even though you do not have a\nsingle cone cell that responds to yellow light.\n\n(Figure 8.5) \n>>>image(cone cells.png.0)\n\nThe photons that reach our eyes which are involved in the perception of\ncolor have either been transmitted, scattered, or emitted. If you are\nreading this on a screen, the photons have been emitted by semiconductor\nlight emitting devices behind the colored pixels, through which they are\ntransmitted. If you are reading this on paper, the light that is\nreaching your eyes has been scattered by the white paper and absorbed by\nthe black ink.[^8.2.8] You may remember from elementary school that for an\nobject to appear a certain color, it absorbs every color but the one it\nappears, which is reflected. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but\nit gets the point across, at least for opaque materials. There are\nactually a few ways that an object produces color when illuminated with\nbroad spectrum light (i.e., white light with maybe a little UV in\nthere). The following figure, (8.6), illustrates the possibilities we\nhave discussed in this chapter.\n\n(Figure 8.6) \n>>>image(summary light interaction.png.0)\n\nIn the top row, an object which is transparent to some wavelengths is\nilluminated with white light. The object (or solution of dyes or\nnanoparticles) absorbs a subset of these wavelengths in accordance with\nits band edges and density of states. The light that is not absorbed by\nthe object or solution is **transmitted** through the medium to our\neyeballs. In the second row, white light containing all the visible\nwavelengths impinges upon an absorbing medium. Some wavelengths of the\nlight are scattered. For metallic nanoparticles, absorption and\nscattering typically occur at the wavelength that corresponds to the\n**surface plasmon resonance** of the particle. That is, the wavelength\nthat is in **resonance** with the energy of the oscillating conduction\nelectrons that make up metallic bonds between metal atoms. So,\nscattering and absorption occur at the same wavelengths for these\nparticles. However, for ordinary scenarios involving colored, opaque\nobjects, the perceived color is what is scattered. So, the wavelengths\nof white light that were not absorbed by the surface are scattered and\nvisible to our eyes.\n\nFinally, light can reach our eyes through the process of direct\nemission. For example, from a fluorescent object, a light bulb, a\nglow-in-the-dark star, or even the sun. Remember that even a\nmonochromatic light source, such as a laser, which emits only at a\nsingle wavelength, triggers more than one cone cell in our eyes.\nUltimately, the perception of a color by our brain is the result of a\nsuperposition of signals arising from multiple types of color-sensitive\nnerve endings that are stimulated in a ratio that depends on the\nincoming wavelength. What the brain does with this information is\nwaaaaay outside the scope of this course. But the bottom line is that we\nperceive it as a color.\n\n[^8.2.1]: Quick; fleeting.\n\n[^8.2.2]: Specifically, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy\n\n[^8.2.3]: FTIR and Raman spectroscopies yield complementary information\n    about the bonding structure of a molecule. Vibrational modes that\n    are active in FTIR are those corresponding to periodic modulation of\n    the molecule's *dipole moment*, while those active under Raman are\n    those corresponding to the molecule's *polarizability*. The\n    quintessential example of the former is CO$_2$ (the carbon atom\n    vibrating between the oxygen atoms) and that of the latter is N$_2$\n    (the nitrogen atoms getting closer together and farther apart).\n\n[^8.2.4]: Because the electron is \"re-combining\" with the positively charged\n    \"hole\" that it left in the valence band\n\n[^8.2.5]: See next paragraph.\n\n[^8.2.6]: Light emission stimulated by light.\n\n[^8.2.7]: The states are individual energy levels that can be occupied by\n    electrons, of which the state at the band edge or *frontier* is only\n    one!\n\n[^8.2.8]: Though ultimately the source of this white light is a light in the\n    room or the sun, which both generate photons by emission.\n",

      "content": "#### Section 3: Quantum mechanical model for absorption: the particle in a box\nThere are several models one can use to predict the electronic\ntransitions and absorption properties of relatively simple absorbers\nlike organic dyes. The simplest---though it is not simple to any\nfirst-time learner---is the **particle-in-a-box** model. The most common\ntype of particle-in-a-box is an electron in an energy well with\ninfinitely hard side walls. Inside the well, the potential energy is\nzero. Beyond the walls, the potential energy is infinite. Imagine that\nan electron is placed in the well. Remember our discussion of photons as\nboth particles and waves? It turns out that *every* object can be\ntreated as both a particle and a wave. That is, even solid, macroscopic\nobjects have wavelike properties. However, for objects of appreciable\nmass, the wavelength is miniscule and the object can be treated as a\nparticle only. Thus, the wavelike properties of matter typically only\nmanifest for electrons, protons, atoms, and very small molecules.\n\nThe behavior of an electron inside the box can be described by a\n**wavefunction**, which is a solution to the **Schr\u00f6dinger equation**\n\n(Equation 8.2) $$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}=E\\psi(x)$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$, $m$ is the mass of\nthe particle (the electron in this case), $\\psi(x)$ is the wave\nfunction, $x$ is the horizontal position variable along the box, and\n$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}$ is the second derivative of the wave function\nwith respect to the position.[^8.3.1] The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an example\nof a **differential equation**, which is a function that is related to\nits own derivative. While there are whole courses in \"diff-eq\" that you\nwill probably take later in your studies, we can get most of the way\nthere just by looking at the equation with the sparest knowledge of\nfirst-semester or AP calculus. The question is, what function has the\nsame form as its second derivative? The answer is sine and cosine\nfunctions! After some guessing and checking, one can come up with the\nfollowing\n\n(Equation 8.3) $$\\psi_n(x)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin{\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}}$$\n\nwhere the index $n$ is an integer $\\geq$ 1. Plugging this solution back\ninto equation (8.2), we get an expression for the energy\n\n(Equation 8.4) $$E_n=\\frac{h^2n^2}{8mL^2}$$\n\nwhere $E_n$ is the energy of the $n^{th}$ energy level. The shapes of\nthe wave functions and the energies of the electrons occupying these\nstates only have physical meaning in the most contrived, idealized\nscenarios. Nevertheless, wave functions can be obtained for a number of\npotentials, such as spherical ones for atoms.\n\nFigure (8.7) below shows the shapes of the wave functions for $n=1$,\ntermed the **ground state**, $n=2$, termed the **first excited state**,\nand $n=3$, the **second excited state**.[^8.3.2] In these diagrams, the wave\nfunction $\\psi(x)$ is the **probability amplitude**; it shows the shape\nof the wave function, and in particular the phases (i.e., above and\nbelow an imaginary horizontal line separating the \"positive\" and\n\"negative\" regions of the function). The square of this function,\n$|\\psi(x)|^2$, is the **probability density**, which is positive (above\nthe horizontal line) everywhere. That is, the function which shows where\nyou are most likely to find the electron within the box. This function\nintegrates to 1, since that is the probability of finding the electron\nsomewhere in the box.\n\n(Figure 8.7) \n>>>image(energy_levels.png.0)\n\n### 8.3.1. Organic dyes and the color of carrots\n\nThe particle-in-a-box model can first seem very obscure. What it is it\ngood for? It turns out that the particle-in-a-box model is most useful\nin determining energy *differences* between states. Often, what we care\nabout most are the gaps between the valence band and the conduction band\nof a molecule or a solid. In some (idealized) cases, it is even possible\nto get a number that's in the right ballpark of the correct value for a\nphysical system. Consider the structure of $\\beta$-carotene, below\n(Figure (8.8)).\n\n(Figure 8.8) \n>>>image(betacarotene.png.0)\n\n$\\beta$-Carotene is the structure most commonly associated with the\norange color of carrots, though in pure form it is more red than orange.\nThe most striking structural feature of $\\beta$-carotene is its long\nconjugated core (that is, alternating double and single bonds). Such a\nstructure gives rise to absorption in the visible region of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.[^8.3.3] It is actually possible to use the\nparticle-in-a-box model to predict that $\\beta$-carotene absorbs in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. Furthermore, if we are a little loose\nwith some of the parameters, we can get it to appear orange.\n\nTo start out, we need to know the approximate length of the\n$\\pi$-conjugated **chromophore**[^8.3.4] and the number of electrons in it.\nLet's say a good approximation is 18.5 \u00c5. Looking at the structure in\nFigure (8.8), we see that there are 22 carbon atoms involved in the\n$\\pi$ system. From general chemistry, we know that some number of\n**atomic orbitals** give rise to the same number of **molecular\norbitals**. So, we will expect to have 22 total molecular orbitals. An\norbital is a place where electrons live, and it can be defined\nmathematically by a wave function, $\\psi(x)$. As you may also remember,\neach bonding molecular orbital gets two electrons, so the first 11 wave\nfunctions starting with the lowest energy---representing the 11\n**bonding orbitals** of $\\beta$-carotene---are filled, while the top 11\nwave functions---representing the **antibonding orbitals** are empty.\nThe bonding orbitals can be treated as the valence band, and the\nantibonding orbitals can be treated as the conduction band. The **band\ngap** is defined as the difference in energy between the **highest\noccupied molecular orbital (HOMO)** (i.e., the valence band edge) and\nthe **lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)** (i.e., the conduction\nband edge). Convince yourself that the difference in energy is given by\nthe following equation:\n\n(Equation 8.5) $$\\Delta E = (n_f^2 - n_i^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ is the initial state and $n_f$ is the final state. When the\nmolecule absorbs a photon, the electron is promoted from $n_i$ to $n_f$.\nIf these two states correspond to the band edges, then $n_i=11$ and\n$n_f=12$. So,\n\n$$\\Delta E = (12^2 - 11^2)\\frac{h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{23 \\times (6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js})^2}{8 (9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})(1.85 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m})^2}$$\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{490 \\, \\text{nm}}$$\n\n\nThe real bandgap of $\\beta$-carotene is closer to 470 nm, but we should\nbe surprised that this super simple model got as close as it did. After\nall, 18.5 \u00c5 is not quite the length of the $\\pi$ system, however, we\nalso ignored all of the electrostatic effects of the protons, the fact\nthat these molecules are twisting and dancing all over the place, and\nthe fact that the electrons are not truly **delocalized**. That is, in a\nreal molecule---not the fake construct of a box with infinite\nwalls---the electrons are not free to occupy any of the length of the\n\"box\" defined by the $\\pi$ system.\n\n### 8.3.2. Quantum dots\n\nA quantum dot is a clever nickname for a **semiconductor nanocrystal**.\nThe moniker \"dot\" emphasizes the quantization of the energy levels. Just\nlike the particle in a box, a quantum dot has **quantized**---can only\ntake on a predefined set of energies---absorption and emission behavior.\nQuantum dots can be made of any direct-bandgap semiconductor, but are\noften metal chalcogenides, including cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe), and lead sulfide (PbS). However, any small\nsemiconductor particle with quantized energy levels will exhibit\nquantum-dot-like behavior. Small platelets of graphene will even\nqualify: **graphene quantum dots**.\n\nThe energy of absorption and emission in a quantum dot follows the same\nqualitative trend as in the particle-in-a-box model: the smaller the\ndot, the more confined the electron, the larger the bandgap, and thus\nthe bluer (higher energy!) the absorption and emission. It is common to\nsee pretty photographs of fluorescent quantum dots like the drawing in\nFigure (8.9), which emphasizes the relationship between particle size\nand band gap.\n\n(Figure 8.9) \n>>>image(quantum dot.png.0)\n\nThe energy of emission of a quantum dot can be predicted by calculating\nits band gap, as determined by\n\n(Equation 8.6)\n$$E_{QD} = E_{bulk} + \\frac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2a^2} (\\frac{1}{m_e} + \\frac{1}{m_h}) - \\frac{1.8e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon\\epsilon_0a}$$\n\nwhere the first term is the energy of the bandgap of the bulk\nsemiconductor (i.e., a block of the material of macroscopic extent), the\nsecond term is due to size confinement (i.e., the particle-in-a-box\nenergy), and the third term is the Coulombic attraction between the\nelectron and the hole. $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by 2$\\pi$,\nand $a$ is the radius of the quantum dot. The band gap of the quantum\ndot is greater than that of the bulk semiconductor by an amount related\nto the particle-in-a-box energy (notice the similarity of the second\nterm of equation (8.6) to that of equation (8.5)). In this case, $m_e$\nand $m_h$ are the masses of the electron and hole.[^8.3.5] Finally, the\nenergy of the bandgap of the quantum dot is reduced by the (favorable)\nattraction between the electron and hole. In fact, the final term in\nequation (8.6) looks a lot like Coulomb's law, equation (2.1).\n\n[^8.3.1]: Don't get scared if you haven't learned calculus before. The first\n    derivative is the rate of change of a function with respect to the\n    variable in the denominator; the second derivative is the rate of\n    change of this rate of change. The second derivative is analogous to\n    the acceleration being the derivative of the velocity, which itself\n    is the derivative of the displacement with respect to time. So, if\n    the function is the displacement, the first derivative is the\n    velocity, and the second derivative is the acceleration.\n\n[^8.3.2]: Note the naming convention where $n=2$ is somehow the first of\n    something. Even the best of us mess this up at least once in our\n    lives.\n\n[^8.3.3]: It also gives it semiconducting behavior. In fact,\n    $\\beta$-carotene is a p-type semiconductor and can be used to make\n    solar cells and thin-film transistors.\n\n[^8.3.4]: The chromophore is the part of the molecule that makes it colored.\n\n[^8.3.5]: Wait, how can a hole have a mass? Because as the hole moves, an\n    electron backfills the hole, and the electron has mass.\n",
