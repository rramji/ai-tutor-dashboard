The exciton diffusion length in both materials is 10 nm and the absorption length at visible wavelengths is 100 nm. These nanocrystals can be processed from solution in hexane. You also have access to the local university nanofabrication facility---including a class-100 cleanroom---which has a suite of tools for evaporation of metals and oxides, and can perform e-beam lithography, photolithography, and molding.
