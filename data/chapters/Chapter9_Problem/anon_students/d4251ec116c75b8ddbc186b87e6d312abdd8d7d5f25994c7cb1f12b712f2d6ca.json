When unpolarized light passes through a layer of liquid crystals in such an aligned phase, the light exiting the polarizer has one of two possible polarizations. Is the light polarized parallel to or perpendicular to the director of the liquid crystal layer? Hint: the polarization follows the same convention as a wire-grid polarizer.'}",

Your company has patents on two types of nanocrystals which, when cast from solution, one has a valence band energy of --5.9 eV and a band gap of 1.6 eV, and the other has a valence band energy of --4.8 eV and a bandgap of 1.6 eV. The exciton diffusion length in both materials is 10 nm and the absorption length at visible wavelengths is 100 nm. These nanocrystals can be processed from solution in hexane. You also have access to the local university nanofabrication facility---including a class-100 cleanroom---which has a suite of tools for evaporation of metals and oxides, and can perform e-beam lithography, photolithography, and molding. Design a solar cell based on the two types of semiconductor nanocrystals. Use as many diagrams as you wish.'}",
