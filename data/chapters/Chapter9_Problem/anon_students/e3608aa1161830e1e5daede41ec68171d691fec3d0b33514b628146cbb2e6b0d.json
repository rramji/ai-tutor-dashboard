When unpolarized light passes through a layer of liquid crystals in such an aligned phase, the light exiting the polarizer has one of two possible polarizations. Is the light polarized parallel to or perpendicular to the director of the liquid crystal layer? Hint: the polarization follows the same convention as a wire-grid polarizer.'}",
