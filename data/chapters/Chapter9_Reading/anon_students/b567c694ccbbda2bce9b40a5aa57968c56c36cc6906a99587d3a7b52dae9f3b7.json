Indeed, absorption and scattering\nlargely determine which photons reach our eyes in the natural\nenvironment. In technology, the engineering of light-matter interactions\nis critical in two areas of application: solar photovoltaic cells and\ndevices for lighting and display. This chapter reviews some of the basic\nprinciples of these devices. For a video primer to this chapter, visit\n\n>>>video(https://youtu.be/zZg5MXKCwCI)\n\nThe photophysical processes we have discussed so far are central to the\noperation of solar cells and light-emitting devices. The first step in\nthe operation of a solar cell occurs when a semiconductor material in\nthe **photoactive layer** absorbs a photon. This material can absorb\nphotons with energy equal to or in excess of its band gap, where the\nprobability of photon absorption depends on the material's absorptivity\nand density of states. The absorption of a photon will cause the\nexcitation of an electron, followed by rapid thermalization of the\nelectron to the band edge. This process produces an electron, $e^-$, in\nthe conduction band and leaves a hole, h$^+$, in the valence band. From\nthere, the details differ depending on the type of solar cell being\ndiscussed.\n\n### 9.1.1. Silicon solar cells\n\nConventional solar cells based on polycrystalline or monocrystalline\nsilicon are what---at the time of this writing---are probably on the\nroof of a nearby building, or the building you are in. This technology\ncurrently exhibits the best compromise between efficiency, lifetime,\nstability, and cost.\n\n#### p-n Junctions\n\nThe basic architecture of a silicon solar cell is a **p-n junction**\n(see Figure (9.1)), in which a slab of p-type silicon makes intimate\ncontact with a slab of n-type silicon. Normal silicon is tetravalent,\nmeaning that it makes four bonds to nearby atoms. The structure of\ncrystalline silicon has a tetrahedral arrangement, which is the same\nstructure as diamond.[^9.1.1] Due to this state in which all covalent bonds\nexactly satisfy the preferred bonding arrangement for silicon, the\nelectrons are not very mobile. Thus, pure silicon is not very conductive\nat all, exhibiting borderline insulating behavior at room temperature.\n\n(Figure 9.1) \n>>>image(p-n junction.png.0)\n\n#### Doping\n\nWhen atoms are added to the structure of pure silicon in a process\ncalled **doping**, the conductivity is altered. For example, \"p-type\"\nsilicon is so-called because it is doped with an element with a valency\nof less than four. The most common p-type dopant is boron, which has\nthree valence electrons. When boron is added to silicon (in minute\nquantities \\<\\<1%), there is a **hole** in the crystal structure due to\na \"missing\" electron since boron can only form a full covalent bond with\nup to three of its neighbors. This hole can backfill with a nearby\nelectron, which thus creates a hole in the bond between two silicon\natoms. The backfilling of these holes by electrons is the mechanism by\nwhich p-type silicon conducts electricity. For n-type silicon, the most\ncommon elements used as dopants are phosphorus or arsenic, which each\nhave five valence electrons. In this case, electrical conduction is\nachieved by the movement of these \"extra\" electrons.\n\nIt is important to remember that neither p-type nor n-type silicon is\nformally charged. Saying that the silicon is p-type does not mean it\ncarries a positive charge. Remember that while there are \"missing\"\nelectrons because there are boron atoms in the crystal lattice, boron\nalso has one fewer proton than silicon. This point is easy to forget.\n\n#### Formation of the depletion zone\n\nWhen p-type and n-type silicon are pressed together to form a p-n\njunction, something weird happens. Some of the extra electrons from the\nn-type side migrate over to the p-type side in order to satisfy the\nunfilled valencies. The result of this migration is that *the p-type\nside becomes negatively charged and the n-type side becomes positively\ncharged!* The charged zones near the interface do not penetrate all the\nway into either side of the junction. The width---**the depletion\nzone**---depends on doping level of the silicon and ultimately on the\nincrease in electrostatic potential energy due to confining charges\nnearby one another. Nevertheless, the positive and negative charges on\neither side of the depletion zone form an electric field. This built-in\nfield is capable of sorting negative and positive charges to opposite\nsides of the junction. The following figure, (9.2), depicts how a p-n\njunction creates an electric field.\n\n(Figure 9.2) \n>>>image(energy level diagram.png.0)\n\n#### Absorption\n\nSilicon is what is called an **indirect band gap semiconductor**, which\nmeans that the valence band edge and the conduction band edge are not\naligned, and thus despite its small band gap of only 1.1 eV, silicon\nmust be a few tens of microns thick in order to absorb all incident\nphotons with energy in excess of the band gap.[^9.1.2] In the cases where a\nphoton is successfully absorbed by the silicon in a p-n junction, the\nelectron in the conduction band and the hole left behind in the valence\nband dissociate from each other immediately. Once separated, these\nphotogenerated electrons and holes actually have negative and positive\ncharges associated with them. The fact that the opposite charges do not\nimmediately recombine is due to the relatively high dielectric constant\nof silicon, which lowers the electrostatic potential energy of the\nindividual charges.\n\n#### The photovoltaic effect\n\nEventually, the charges feel the pull of the built-in electric field of\nthe depletion zone and are shuttled to opposite ends of the device. The\ndifference in potential energy per charge---i.e., the voltage of the\ndevice---depends on the difference in energy between the conduction band\nof the p-type side and the valence band of the n-type side (since those\nare the bands where the charges live). When there is no load connected\nto the device (or a load of infinite resistance), this voltage is called\nthe **open-circuit voltage, *V*$_{oc}$** When the two sides of the\ndevice are connected with a thick metal wire (effectively zero\nresistance), the charges move into the circuit to recombine with each\nother. The resulting maximum possible current is called the\n**short-circuit current, *I*$_{sc}$**. When a load is placed in between\nthe two terminals, the maximum power achievable is ideally equal to\n*V*$_{oc}$ $\\times$ *I*$_{sc}$ but never is. Instead, various parasitic\nprocesses in the device reduce the maximum power to something like\n60-95% of the ideal value. The ratio of this value to the ideal value is\ncalled the **fill factor**. The ratio of the maximum power to the input\nsolar power is the **power conversion efficiency**. The diagram shown in\nFigure (9.3) depicts how these values relate to one another.\n\n(Figure 9.3) \n>>>image(jv curve.png.0)\n\n### 9.1.2. Excitonic solar cells\n\nThere is another type of solar cell based on organic semiconductors and\nsemiconductor nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dots). This type of solar\ncell---termed an **excitonic solar cell**---differs from conventional\nsilicon solar cells in several ways, enumerated as follows.\n\n1.  The dielectric constant of the medium is lower than silicon.\n\n2.  The low dielectric constant means that that photogenerated charges\n    are not separated immediately. Instead, an electrostatically bound\n    and neutral electron-hole pair---**an exciton**---is generated.\n\n3.  This exciton must reach an interface between a material which is an\n    electron donor and one which is an electron acceptor.\n\n4.  The donor serves the same function as the p-type silicon in a\n    conventional cell, but the donor is not doped and thus has no mobile\n    charge carriers.\n\n5.  Since there is no doping, putting a donor and an acceptor in\n    intimate contact does not produce a depletion zone.\n\n6.  Most organic semiconductors and quantum dots are **direct band gap\n    semiconductors**, which means that they can be up to 1000$\\times$\n    thinner than silicon cells.\n\n7.  Excitonic materials can often be deposited from solution over large\n    areas and at low cost.\n\n8.  Unfortunately, excitonic solar cells have lower efficiencies and\n    device lifetimes compared to conventional silicon cells.\n\n#### Generation of photovoltage in excitonic cells\n\nGiven all of the ways in which these excitonic---\"alternative\"---types\nof semiconductors differ from conventional silicon, it is surprising\nthat they exhibit a photovoltaic effect at all. With no depletion layer,\none may question how the charges reach the opposite sides of the device.\nIn the case of excitonic cells, it is essential that the metallic\nelectrodes used to extract the charges have different values of **work\nfunction**. The work function of the anode should be close to the\nvalence band edge of the donor (where the holes come out, very roughly\naround 5 eV), and the work function of the cathode must be close to the\nconduction band edge of the acceptor (where the electrons come out, very\nroughly around 3 eV). When the electrodes are connected, there is a\nshuttling of electrons from the cathode to the anode, and thus the\ncathode takes on a small positive charge and the anode takes on a small\nnegative charge. Thus, an electric field is created in the device. Once\nthe exciton splits into free charge carriers---i.e., where the electron\ngoes to the acceptor and the hole goes into the donor---the electric\nfield in the device causes the electrons to drift toward the cathode and\nthe holes to drift toward the anode. This process is the basis of the\nphotovoltaic effect in excitonic solar cells.\n\nOne major complication of the excitonic solar cell is that the distance\nan exciton can travel---**exciton diffusion length**---is typically 5-10\ntimes shorter than the thickness of the film needed to absorb most of\nthe light, which for our purposes can be taken as the **absorption\nlength**. Thus, typical exciton diffusion lengths are on the order of 10\nnm, while typical absorption lengths can be on the order of 100 nm. A\nconsequence of this disparity is that devices with a flat, planar\ninterface between the donor and the acceptor are inherently inefficient.\nThe reason is that for devices with thicknesses of 100 nm, most of the\nexcitons generated will not reach the interface, and will just collapse:\nthe energy will either be radiated as a fluorescent photon or it will be\nlost as heat. For devices of 10 nm or so in thickness, most of the\nexcitons will find the interface and separate, but most of the light\nwill pass through the device, unabsorbed.\n\nThe most common way around this challenge is to cast both the donor and\nthe acceptor material from the same solution. Under favorable\nconditions, the two materials separate into a donor phase and an\nacceptor phase whose dimensions are close to the exciton diffusion\nlength, but whose overall thickness is close to the absorption length.\nThe resulting blended architecture is called the **bulk\nheterojunction**, see Figure (9.4). This architecture simplifies\nprocessing but has some disadvantages, as enumerated below.\n\n(Figure 9.4) \n>>>image(BHJ.png.0)\n\n1.  The donor and the acceptor phases make contact with both electrodes\n\n2.  Some donor and acceptor phases get \"stranded\" like an island in a\n    sea of the other material\n\n3.  The chemical potential gradient established for a planar device\n    which ordinarily pushes charges in the correct direction now faces\n    in random directions\n\nMethods to achieve the best of both worlds of the planar and bulk\nheterojunction involve the fabrication of an **ordered bulk\nheterojunction** in which top-down nanolithography or bottom-up self\nassembly processes are used to create precisely interpenetrating\nnetworks with bicontinuity of the two phases. Notwithstanding, these\nefforts have so far not been successful, and the bulk heterojunction\ntype excitonic solar cell (typically polymer based) is the most\nefficient type of excitonic solar cell. Moreover, it is becoming\nincreasingly apparent that some level of molecular mixing at the\ninterfaces (shown as the purple \"halos\" around the red and blue phases\nin Figure (9.4)) is actually better for charge separation than a\ngeometry in which the layers are perfectly separated.\n\n### 9.1.3. Perovskite solar cells\n\nA final type of solar cell which has some characteristics of the\nexcitonic solar cell, especially its ultrathin stature, is the\n**perovskite solar cell**. A perovksite cell is so named because the\ncrystal structure of the semiconductor absorber is the same as the\nmineral with the name of perovskite, CaTiO$_3$. The general formula is\nABX$_3$, where A is usually a polar organic molecule (methylammonium,\nCH$_3$NH$_3$), B is a metal, and X is a halide. The composition of\nperovskite materials that is among the most promising---or at least\nwhere most of the research is headed---is methylammonium lead iodide,\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$, see Figure (9.5).\n\n(Figure 9.5) \n>>>image(perovskite.png.0)\n\nThe way in which a perovskite device works has elements of both a\nconventional (i.e., silicon) and excitonic (i.e., organic) solar cell.\nFirst off, the perovskite material is a direct bandgap semiconductor,\nmeaning that the device can be very thin.[^9.1.3] The perovskite structure\nalso has a high dielectric constant, and shields charges effectively.\nThus, as soon as a photon is absorbed, free charges are immediately\ngenerated. These charges drift around the active layer. What is required\nis charge-selective contacts that shuttle either electrons, **the\nelectron transport layer (ETL)**, or holes, **the hole transport layer\n(HTL)**, out to the electrodes. This selective separation of charges is\nthe basis of the photovoltaic effect in perovskite solar cells. Often,\nthe ETL, HTL, or both, are organic, and sometimes are $\\pi$-conjugated\npolymers. Thus, innovations in the chemistry and physics of organic\nsemiconductors could be useful in the development of perovskite devices.\n\n### 9.1.4. Tandem solar cells\n\nThere are many ways in which combining the attributes of solar cells are\nadvantageous. For example, connecting cells in parallel can generate\nlarger currents (equivalent to increasing the size of a single cell).\nConversely, connecting cells in series can generate larger voltages.\nConnection in series enables one to create **tandem devices**, in which\ndifferent cells with different absorption characteristics are\nconstructed on top of one another, like a stack of pancakes (Figure\n(9.6)). This approach allows one to tailor the absorption properties of\na collection of cells to cover as much of the solar spectrum as\npossible. For example, a large-bandgap semiconductor (absorbs\nhigher-energy, bluer light) might sit atop a low-bandgap semiconductor\n(absorbs lower-energy, redder light). To reiterate, when one connects\ncells in parallel, one adds up the currents of the individual cells, and\nwhen one connects cells in series, one adds up the voltages.\n\n(Figure 9.6) \n>>>image(tandem.png.0)\n\n[^9.1.1]: Silicon and carbon are both members of group 4 of the period\n    table, and thus have four valence electrons.\n\n[^9.1.2]: For context, other semiconductor materials used in solar cells,\n    such as perovskites, can capture comparable amounts of light with\n    sub-micron film thicknesses\n\n[^9.1.3]: The bandgap can also be adjusted by tuning the elemental\n    composition of the absorber layer.\n",

To reiterate, when one connects\ncells in parallel, one adds up the currents of the individual cells, and\nwhen one connects cells in series, one adds up the voltages.\n\n(Figure 9.6) \n>>>image(tandem.png.0)\n\n[^9.1.1]: Silicon and carbon are both members of group 4 of the period\n    table, and thus have four valence electrons.\n\n[^9.1.2]: For context, other semiconductor materials used in solar cells,\n    such as perovskites, can capture comparable amounts of light with\n    sub-micron film thicknesses\n\n[^9.1.3]: The bandgap can also be adjusted by tuning the elemental\n    composition of the absorber layer.\n",
