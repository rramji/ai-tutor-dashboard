Take the interaction data from each session of each student
Clean it up
Ask LLM to summarize, maybe highlight painpoints and somehow evaluate student performance
Design some schema that this should fit into?
Aggregate this information and send to claude again? or extend workflow otherwise to extract higher level patterns

Potential workflow:
- generate keywords
- embedding vectors
- clustering to identify groups
- identify clusters and summarize
notes: need some way to avoid just getting the exact homework questions in the clusters

What metrics should we be looking at on the dashboard? what do instructors want to see?

Hypotheses and ways to measure them:
- Measurements for learning outcomes - what kind of measurements can we define that could feasibly be done on the student interaction data?
- Does using the tutor correlate with improved scores in the class? Ask david if we can see the grades? Generally would require an LMS integration
- Is there a way to assess interaction trajectories to see if there are learning outcomes or something?
- Come up with a list of potential metrics that would be useful for this class
- metrics that are useful for answering research questions vs metrics that are useful for instructors

Share latests iteration of dashboard in meeting tomorrow, poll group for input + consensus on metrics of interest
Mockups for some of the other metrics?
